Immunotherapies hold promise, but cancer antigen-targeting immunotherapies have largely failed to induce effective T cell receptor-mediated antitumor response. However, T cell-engaging bispecific antibodies (T-BsAbs) have yet to be adequately explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Rehumanized STEAP1-IgG was used to build T-BsAb (named BC261) using the 2+2 IgG-[L]-scFv platform carrying the anti-CD3 huOKT3 scFv as the second specificity. Its binding epitope mapping, species cross-reactivity, tumor cell line staining, and in vitro cytotoxicity were investigated thoroughly. Its potency in driving tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was quantified using bioluminescence, correlated with in vivo antitumor response against cell line-derived or patient-derived xenografts (CDXs or PDXs) and compared with anti-STEAP1 T-BsAbs built on representative antibody platforms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>BC261 binding epitope was mapped to its second extracellular domain of STEAP1 shared among canine and primate orthologs. BC261 induced potent cytotoxicity against panels of EFT, prostate cancer, and canine osteosarcoma cell lines despite their low antigen density. BC261 drove significantly more TILs into tumors (30-fold) and exerted superior antitumor effects compared with the other standard BsAb platforms. The antitumor efficacy of BC261 was consistent against EFT and prostate cancer CDXs and PDXs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>BC261 was highly efficient in driving T cell infiltration and tumor ablation. Either as stand-alone therapeutics or for ex vivo armed T cells, this novel anti-STEAP1 T-BsAb BC261 has therapeutic potential.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>antibodies</kwd><kwd>neoplasm</kwd><kwd>antigens</kwd><kwd>neoplasm</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>T-lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>sarcoma</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source>

STEAP1 is highly expressed in EFT, and its expression correlates with the EWS-ETS fusion proteins.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58 59</xref> STEAP1 is induced by <italic toggle="yes">EWS-FLI1</italic> translocation, and its expression promotes proliferation, invasiveness, anchorage-independent colony formation, tumorigenicity, and metastasis of EFT,<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> implicating close relationship between STEAP1 and the EWS-ETS translocation. Interestingly, all relapsed tumors after BC261 therapy showed regression when retreated with BC261-EATs (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 5</xref>). This sensitivity to retreatment contrasts with most published studies where tumor escape following T cell immunotherapy is typically associated with target antigen loss or downregulation.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41 60</xref> If STEAP1 expression is associated with cancer cell stemness, a property driven by the EWS-ETS fusion protein, it could explain the high potency of BC261 targeting STEAP1.<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> It is also notable that 50%&#x02013;70% of prostate cancers have similar chromosomal rearrangements resulting in aberrant expression of an oncogenic ETS family transcription factor, and these ETS factors interact with the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint protein EWS, leading to gene activation, cell migration, transformation, and tumorigenesis.<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> Understanding the mechanistic pathways and biology behind STEAP1 and EWS/ETS-related fusions should help future design and testing of immunotherapeutics directed at STEAP1.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>One of the major findings of our study is the discovery of the shared epitope of STEAP1 among human, dogs, and non-human primates (NHP). &#x02018;On-target off-tumor toxicities&#x02019; from cellular immunotherapy can induce serious side effects that are difficult to predict in current preclinical mouse models due to the specificity of BsAbs or CARs for human antigens. Although STEAP1 expression is highly restricted to tumor tissues and absent in vital organs, it is found at lower levels in normal tissues such as prostate, bladder, liver, kidney, pancreas, and skeletal muscle.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 27 63</xref> As a non-human preclinical model, dogs and NHP may provide alternatives for evaluating not only the efficacy but also the &#x02018;on-target off tumor toxicity&#x02019;. Besides, canine osteosarcoma is one of the most common cancers in dogs.<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> As an outbred non-human tumor model, it provides an alternative for testing STEAP1 antibody-based therapeutics both for toxicities and for efficacy. Since osteosarcoma is also difficult to cure in canine hosts, STEAP1-targeted antibody-based therapeutics could fulfill another unmet canine need. Even though the STEAP1 protein is highly restricted to tumors, long-term persistence of the cytotoxic drugs or cytotoxic immune effector cells could be harmful. While CAR T cells are life-long and such toxicities could be prolonged and life-threatening, BsAb-driven T cells or EATs have limited functional life expectancy only weeks. As the BsAbs get metabolized, T cells should revert to their non-specific states, reducing or terminating the risk of life-threatening long-term toxicities. In this respect, targeting STEAP1 using T-BsAb and EAT offers safter alternatives.</p><p>Taken together, STEAP1 is an appealing target for T cell immunotherapy, and STEAP1 T-BsAb BC261 offers a novel solution to engage T cells to traffic into immunologically &#x02018;cold&#x02019; STEAP1(+) malignancies. BC261 induced robust antitumor responses without long-term toxicities for stand-alone BsAb or BsAb armed T cells, warranting clinical development for human solid tumors with major unmet need, such as EFT and prostate cancers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to especially thank Xu Hong for analyzing STEAP1 BsAbs&#x02019; affinity to CD3.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> @StevenTYLin08</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>T-YL and JAP contributed equally.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> T-YL, JAP, and N-KVC designed the experiments, interpreted and analyzed the results, and wrote the manuscript.
