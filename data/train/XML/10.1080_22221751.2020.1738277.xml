These noncoding RNAs are characterized by their unique splicing reactions to form covalently closed loop structures and play important RNA regulatory roles in cells. Recent studies showed that circRNA expressions were perturbed in viral infections and circRNAs might serve as potential antiviral targets. We investigated the host ceRNA network changes and biological relevance of circRNAs in human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial (Calu-3) cells infected with the highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). A total of &#x02265;49337 putative circRNAs were predicted. Among the 7845 genes which generated putative circRNAs, 147 (1.9%) of them each generated &#x02265;30 putative circRNAs and were involved in various biological, cellular, and metabolic processes, including viral infections. Differential expression (DE) analysis showed that the proportion of DE circRNAs significantly (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) increased at 24 h-post infection. These DE circRNAs were clustered into 4 groups according to their time-course expression patterns and demonstrated inter-cluster and intra-cluster variations in the predicted functions of their host genes. Our comprehensive circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network identified 7 key DE circRNAs involved in various biological processes upon MERS-CoV infection. Specific siRNA knockdown of two selected DE circRNAs (circFNDC3B and circCNOT1) significantly reduced MERS-CoV load and their target mRNA expression which modulates various biological pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and ubiquitination pathways. These results provided novel insights into the ceRNA network perturbations, biological relevance of circRNAs, and potential host-targeting antiviral strategies for MERS-CoV infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>MERS-CoV</kwd><kwd>competing endogenous RNA</kwd><kwd>circRNA</kwd><kwd>miRNA</kwd><kwd>mRNA</kwd></kwd-group><support-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>

They are abundantly found in human cells and play important RNA regulatory roles, including acting as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, interacting with RNA binding proteins (RBPs), as well as modulating the transcription of parental genes by interacting with RNA polymerase II [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis proposes that RNA transcripts, including circRNAs, messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), contain miRNA response elements (MREs) which compete among themselves for miRNA binding to regulate the expression of each other [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. circRNAs possess miRNA-sponging activity and counteract the miRNA&#x02019;s inhibitory activity on the target mRNA [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Recent studies showed that the expressions of circRNAs were perturbed in viral infections caused by both DNA (hepatitis B virus, Kaposi&#x02019;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, and simian vacuolating virus 40) and RNA [Ebola virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), influenza A viruses, and avian leukosis virus subgroup-J] viruses [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;15</xref>], and that these circRNAs might serve as potential antiviral targets [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging human-pathogenic coronavirus which has caused &#x0003e;2400 infections and &#x0003e;800 deaths worldwide since 2012 [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref>]. Despite a high mortality rate of &#x0003e;30%, the virus-host interaction and pathogenesis of this emerging infection remains incompletely understood [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, the host ceRNAs profile changes and the functions of circRNAs in MERS-CoV and other human-pathogenic coronavirus infections have not been reported. In this study, we used MERS-CoV as a model to investigate the host ceRNA network changes and biological relevance of circRNAs in CoV infection. We showed that MERS-CoV significantly perturbed a high number of circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs which were involved in a wide range of biological processes. We also validated the effects of selected circRNAs in MERS-CoV replication and provided new insights into potential host-targeting antiviral strategies through the manipulation of circRNAs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials methods" id="S002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S002-S2001"><title>Virus and cells</title><p>MERS-CoV (strain HCoV-EMC/2012) was kindly provided by Ron Fouchier (Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands) [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

These 147 genes were shown to be involved in various biological, cellular, and metabolic processes in Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis (Supplementary Figure 1). Moreover, many of these genes were involved in viral infection.

Explorations on the RBPs that could bind to these circRNAs through CircInteractome showed that both circFNDC3B and circCNOT1 contained multiple binding sites for Ago2 protein and supported our postulation that these circRNAs could act as miRNA sponges (<xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A) [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We designed divergent qRT-PCR primers and performed RNase R resistance experiments to examine the expression of these circRNAs with or without MERS-CoV infection (Supplementary Table 1). As shown in <xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B, no significant reduction in the relative expression of the two circRNAs was detected after RNase R treatment, while the expression of the mRNAs were greatly affected. To examine the biological relevance of these circRNAs during MERS-CoV infection, siRNAs targeting the back-splicing site of circFNDC3B and circCNOT1 were synthesized and transfected into Calu-3 cells to assess whether depletion of these two candidate circRNAs could limit virus replication (Supplementary Table 1). Our results confirmed that our siRNAs could efficiently knock down the circRNA expression (<xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>C) but not the linear form (Supplementary Figure 2), and most of the tested siRNAs significantly reduced MERS-CoV (but not SARS-CoV or influenza A/H1N1 viruses) replication in both cell lysate and culture supernatant (<xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>D and Supplementary Figure 3). Importantly, the siRNAs did not affect cell viability (Supplementary Figure 4). Upon successful knock down (Supplementary Figure 5A), the viral load reduction by si-circFNDC3 and si-circCNOT1 were similarly observed in HFL cells (Supplementary Figure 5B). Moreover, over-expression of circFNDC3B and circCNOT1 in Calu-3 cells enhanced virus replication (Supplementary Figure 6). To validate our hypothesis that circFNDC3B and circCNOT1 function by sequestering their target miRNAs to regulate mRNA expression, we evaluated the expression of their representative target mRNAs after knockdown with si-circFNDC3B-2 or si-circCNOT1-1 which were selected based on their higher inhibitory activity of MERS-CoV replication over si-circFNDC3B-1 or si-circCNOT1-2, respectively. As shown in <xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>E, circFNDC3B depletion significantly reduced the expression of its representative target mRNAs, including MAP3K9, MYO15B, and SPOCK1. Similarly, circCNOT1 depletion reduced the expression of its target mRNAs, including MAP3K9, MEF2C, USP15, and ZBTB11. Taken together, these results supported our hypothesis that the circRNAs identified in our circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network significantly impacted MERS-CoV replication.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S004"><title>Discussion</title><p>As an integral component of the ceRNA network, circRNAs harbouring MREs can regulate gene expression by functioning as miRNA sponges to release the inhibitory effects of miRNAs on target genes [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The sponging effect of circRNAs has been shown to be more efficient than that of the linear miRNA and lncRNA transcripts [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. It has previously been shown that various DNA and RNA viruses (herpesviruses, polyomaviruses, retroviruses, and hepaciviruses) could modulate viral replication via miRNA-mediated gene regulation [<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In contrast, the role of circRNA in viral replication is less well understood. For coronaviruses, only two circRNA profile analyses on the animal-pathogenic PEDV and TGEV have been reported [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In this study, we used the highly human-pathogenic MERS-CoV as a model to demonstrate the interactions of circRNAs with other major components of the host cell ceRNA network and validated the effects of these circRNAs on coronavirus replication.</p><p>In our comprehensive profiling of the circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in human lung epithelial cells with or without MERS-CoV infection, a number of important observations were made. First, a large number of circRNAs (49337) were predicted, including 16285 (33.0%) previously annotated circRNAs and 33052 (67.0%) novel putative circRNAs. Most of these circRNAs were derived from coding regions (83.0%). This is in line with the findings from PEDV-infected porcine intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and may represent a conserved character of coronavirus-infected cells. Second, most (84.5%) of these putative circRNAs had low expression levels as evidenced by their small number (1&#x02013;5) of supported reads. This finding corroborated with those identified in PEDV-infected porcine intestinal epithelial cells, avian leukosis virus subgroup-J-infected chicken hepatic cells, and simian vacuolating virus 40-infected Vero cells [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Third, the mean GC content percentage of the circRNAs was significantly higher than those of the miRNAs and mRNAs. As the GC content is positively correlated with the stability of RNA transcripts, our finding corroborated with the consensus that circRNAs are usually highly stable [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Finally, our data showed that the number of different circRNAs generated from individual host genes was highly variable, suggesting a differential potential of gene regulation by diverse host genes through circRNA generation.</p><p>Our comprehensive circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network showed that MERS-CoV induced significant changes in the expression of many host cell circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs. Compared with the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells infected with influenza A/H3N2, our network in MERS-CoV-infected Calu-3 cells demonstrated a higher number of DE circRNAs (7 vs 3), miRNAs (19 vs 1), and mRNAs (547 vs 9). This might imply that MERS-CoV infection induced a more profound and global change in the host ceRNA network compared to the less virulent influenza A/H3N2, although the differences in experimental set up should also be considered [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The DE circRNAs in our network were associated with a wide range of biological, cellular, and molecular processes. Interestingly, using both KEGG pathway and GO functional analyses, we showed that ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis was significantly perturbed in MERS-CoV infection. The papain-like protease of MERS-CoV exhibits deubiquitinating activity and is involved in proteolysis of the viral polyprotein during virus replication [<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Inhibitors of MERS-CoV papain-like protease such as 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine exhibit antiviral activity <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Modulation of the circRNAs associated with ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis identified in our study may provide a new antiviral strategy for MERS-CoV infection.</p><p>To validate the biological relevance of the DE circRNAs identified in our network, we selected two DE circRNAs and investigated their effects on MERS-CoV replication and the expression of their target genes in human lung epithelial cells with or without siRNA knockdown. Our results showed that specific knockdown of circFNDC3B and circCNOT1 significantly reduced MERS-CoV viral load in both Calu-3 and HFL cells, which was potentially associated with the downregulation of circFNDC3B- and circCNOT1-regulated target genes. For example, MAP3K9 is an upstream modulator of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways which influences many aspects of cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis [<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/MAPK signalling response is specifically modulated in MERS-CoV infection [<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In this regard, we showed that siRNA knockdown of either circFND3B or circCNOT1 resulted in significantly reduced expression of MAP3K9 and provided novel insights to modulate the ERK/MAPK pathway as a host-targeting antiviral strategy for MERS-CoV infection.</p><p>In addition to MAP3K9, siRNA knockdown of circFNDC3B or circCNOT1 similarly resulted in significantly reduced expression of other target genes. Ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15) promotes RIG-I-mediated antiviral signalling by interacting with ubiquitin E3 ligase tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25) and plays important roles in the replication of various DNA and RNA viruses, including human papillomaviruse (HPV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">55&#x02013;58</xref>]. Myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) is a transcription factor that is associated with the super-enhancer activity and cancer progression of Epstein&#x02013;Barr virus infection [<xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The functions of SPARC/Osteonectin, Cwcv and Kazal-like Domains Proteoglycan 1 (SPOCK1), Zinc Finger and BTB Domain Containing 11 (ZBTB11), and myosin XVB (MYO15B) in viral infection are unclear.</p><p>In summary, our study provided novel insights into the ceRNA network perturbations and biological relevance of circRNAs in MERS-CoV infection. Knockdown of specific DE circRNAs in MERS-CoV infection resulted in significantly reduced viral load and may pave new ways for host-targeting antiviral strategies for this highly virulent emerging virus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SM5341" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media xlink:href="TEMI_A_1738277_SM5341.zip"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank HaploX Biotechnology (Jiangxi, China) (RNA sequencing) and Dong Chen and Yu Zhang from Appreciate the Beauty of Life, Inc.
