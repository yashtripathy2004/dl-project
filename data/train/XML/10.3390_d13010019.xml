individually and synergistically, have on the plant community and ecosystem dynamics.</s></p><p><s>Elser et al. <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref> and Fay et al. <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref> detail synergistic effects of N and P, demonstrating that in terrestrial ecosystems, simultaneous addition of N and P (NP) causes a larger response than either nutrient does individually.</s><s>Studies have shown increased deposition affects more than just productivity.</s><s>For example, increases in vegetative biomass after three years of nutrient addition cause subsequent decreases in sub-canopy light availability <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10]</ref>, often resulting in plant species loss <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref><ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref><ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref><ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Studies investigating plant community response to nutrient additions indicate that nutrient enrichment can change community spatial and temporal variability, as well as alter succession patterns and community structure <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref><ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref><ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>La Pierre and Smith <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref> found that species experiencing chronic fertilization express differences in functional traits compared to species in ambient conditions.</s><s>These previous works highlight the importance of investigating plant traits to understand mechanisms altering community structure in response to chronic nutrient enrichment <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref><ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref><ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Although the aforementioned research has laid the foundation regarding potential effects of nutrient enrichment on global change, gaps remain.</s><s>For example, a number of studies have investigated trait-based community patterns in response to nutrient enrichment <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21,</ref><ref target="#b21" type="bibr">22]</ref>, but uncertainties still remain regarding effects of nutrient enrichment on functional trait-based diversity (i.e., diversity of traits).</s></p><p><s>Limitations using species diversity to express plant diversity have increased interest in quantifying functional trait-based diversity (functional diversity) to answer questions regarding plant community organization, species interactions, and response to disturbances <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23,</ref><ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24]</ref>.</s><s>Functional diversity has become an important metric for understanding how species, as dynamic parts of a community, change organismal traits through interactions with the environment, which can impact ecosystem functioning <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25,</ref><ref target="#b25" type="bibr">26]</ref>.</s><s>Functional diversity metrics are indicators of community structural response to environmental perturbations <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref> and can be measured across multiple scales <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Both functional alphaand beta-diversity are computed using quantitative functional trait data collected on members of the plant community.</s><s>Here we define functional beta-diversity as the site-to-site variation among functional trait defined communities, while functional alpha-diversity is defined as functional trait diversity at the local-scale (i.e., within a plot).</s><s>These diversity metrics, along with analysis of specific differences in functional trait expression, can help decipher mechanisms of altered trait-based community structure in response to nutrient enrichment and increased productivity.</s><s>Current research focusing on functional diversity does not identify unified patterns of plant communities in response to nutrient enrichment, suggesting that responses may be dependent on combinations of nutrient treatments and regional or local pressures <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[29]</ref><ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[30]</ref><ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[31]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Most prominent nutrient enrichment studies have been conducted in agroecosystems or prairie grasslands with different soil profiles than coastal grasslands.</s><s>Coastal grassland soils are characterized by their highly leached sandy composition resulting in low nutrient content and low water holding capacity <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Increased N deposition is expected to occur in coastal ecosystems <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[33,</ref><ref target="#b33" type="bibr">34]</ref>, and previous work has highlighted the need to understand how nutrients influence coastal plant communities <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">[35,</ref><ref target="#b35" type="bibr">36]</ref>.</s><s>Focusing on the coastal system response to nutrient accumulation will identify mechanisms altering coastal plant community function, leading to improved predictions of community trajectory and future functional change <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[34,</ref><ref target="#b34" type="bibr">35]</ref>.</s><s>This is especially true for barrier island systems, where plant communities are tied closely to disturbance response <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">[37]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Barrier islands are coastal systems occurring along 15% of coastlines globally with most occurring in the northern hemisphere <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[38]</ref>.</s><s>Geographic areas where barrier islands are common coincide with areas expected to experience increased synthetic fertilizer use <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[33,</ref><ref target="#b38" type="bibr">39]</ref>.</s><s>By 2100, N enrichment in the continental U.S. is expected to increase by 19%, with the Atlantic coast experiencing the largest regional increase <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[39]</ref>.</s><s>High nutrient enrichment from run-off and atmospheric deposition is a major influence on barrier island plant communities given the prominence of sandy-soil compositions and high N limitation <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[32,</ref><ref target="#b35" type="bibr">36]</ref>.</s><s>Nutrient enrichment studies on coastal dune systems show that N addition causes long-term plant community change <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[36]</ref>, yet P has not been identified as a limiting nutrient in terrestrial coastal systems <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[40,</ref><ref target="#b40" type="bibr">41]</ref>.</s><s>Patterns revealing NP synergistic co-limitation at global scales necessitates investigation of both nutrients in coastal systems <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9]</ref>.</s><s>We build upon previous research by investigating effects of nutrient enrichment on trait-based communities of a mid-Atlantic coastal mesic grassland.</s></p><p><s>Our goal was twofold.</s><s>First, we tested how chronic (3 year) nutrient addition affects trait-based community structure and function.</s><s>Specifically, we tested whether N, P, and NP enrichment increases community-level biomass and/or modifies specific functional trait expressions.</s><s>We hypothesize that, due to N limitation in coastal systems, biomass will show notable increase under N and NP treatments, with NP prompting a co-limitation effect such that biomass produced after NP fertilization will be significantly higher than biomass produced by N or P alone.</s><s>Furthermore, we predict that functional traits promoting resource acquisition (e.g., height, specific leaf area, and leaf N traits) will be expressed in N and NP treatments, due to increased competition for light in nutrient-rich environments.</s><s>Second, we investigated community-level functional trait change using trait-based community composition and trait diversity (functional alpha-and beta-diversity).</s><s>We hypothesize that N and NP treatments will alter trait-based community composition and that such changes will be accompanied by increased functional alpha-and beta-diversity.</s><s>Furthermore, we expect that functional alpha-and beta-diversity will have a significant relationship with biomass productivity.</s><s>Identifying how nutrients impact productivity, specific functional trait expressions, and trait-based community composition and diversity may improve predictions of trait-based vegetation change in sand-based coastal grasslands as global change drivers like nutrient enrichment persist.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Discussion<p><s>We show the influence of chronic (3 year) nutrient enrichment on community-level biomass, specific functional trait expressions, and trait-based community composition and diversity in a coastal grassland.</s><s>It is clear that N enrichment had significant impacts on community biomass production.</s><s>NP exhibited a synergistic co-limitation effect on biomass production such that NP treatments produced higher biomass than either N or P treatments individually.</s><s>These findings are consistent with previous studies showing synergistic nutrient effects in other terrestrial systems <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9]</ref>.</s><s>However, it is interesting that P alone had no effect on productivity because it has been shown to increase productivity in other grassland systems <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</s><s>This is particularly surprising at our grassland site because, according to our NMDS results, P alters community species composition, even without evidence of causing differences in productivity or functional trait-based composition.</s><s>We found that biomass production in N and NP plots are on average four and seven times higher than C plots, respectively.</s><s>This follows global scale trends which indicate that N and NP deposition increases biomass production by, on average, 18% and 40% compared to C plots, respectively <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Considering the extent of coastal grassland distribution worldwide, our findings emphasize the importance of including more coastal grasslands when investigating response to nutrient enrichment at the global scale.</s></p><p><s>Our investigation of specific functional traits shows that some functional trait expressions associated with competition and altered nutrient acquisition (i.e., height and δ 15 N) were significantly higher in N and NP plots, similar to other nutrient enrichment studies <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20,</ref><ref target="#b61" type="bibr">62]</ref>.</s><s>Differences in plant height are likely driven by increased competition for light, as N and NP increase aboveground biomass production <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20,</ref><ref target="#b61" type="bibr">62]</ref>.</s><s>It is important to note that increased height can also be a result of higher N acquisition, allowing for species to grow more prolifically than if they were in an N-limited environment.</s><s>We found that other traits remained unchanged among nutrient enrichment treatments (i.e., %N and SLA), indicating that certain traits are conserved in coastal systems regardless of nutrient additions.</s><s>These trait responses stray from what global patterns have shown, such as those found by Firn et al. <ref target="#b18" type="bibr">[19]</ref>, which identify leaf N content as an important indicator of nutrient inputs.</s><s>As leaf N was not affected by fertilization, investigating root traits in future studies may inform aboveground responses.</s><s>Previous research highlights that increased N acquisition by roots may affect other functional traits, like δ 15 N, which correlates with leaf N content <ref target="#b62" type="bibr">[63]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Foliar δ 15 N is traditionally used as the primary metric for whole plant δ 15 N and varies as a result of multiple environmental changes including N deposition <ref target="#b63" type="bibr">[64]</ref>.</s><s>Increased availability and uptake of N can result in δ 15 N enrichment in plant tissues <ref target="#b62" type="bibr">[63,</ref><ref target="#b64" type="bibr">65,</ref><ref target="#b65" type="bibr">66]</ref>, most typically through mechanisms of decreasing plant dependence on fungal and microbial associates to capture and fix N <ref target="#b51" type="bibr">[52,</ref><ref target="#b66" type="bibr">67]</ref>.</s><s>In our study, we found that CWM δ 15 N values in C plots was ~0 ppt, which could suggest plants in untreated communities rely on N 2 fixation through symbiotic rhizosphere relationships, a mechanism found in the dominant coastal shrub M. cerifera <ref target="#b67" type="bibr">[68,</ref><ref target="#b68" type="bibr">69]</ref>.</s><s>Symbiotic relationships are an important N acquisition strategy in N-limited coastal systems <ref target="#b69" type="bibr">[70]</ref> and may be disrupted by N additions.</s><s>While we did not specifically test for changes in microbial communities associated with plant root systems, increased δ 15 N enrichment has been linked to plant dissociation from N-fixing bacteria, mycorrhizal fungi, or both when N becomes more readily available during fertilization <ref target="#b70" type="bibr">[71]</ref><ref target="#b71" type="bibr">[72]</ref><ref target="#b72" type="bibr">[73]</ref>.</s><s>Previous research has also shown that soil microbial communities can be directly affected by nutrient inputs <ref target="#b73" type="bibr">[74,</ref><ref target="#b74" type="bibr">75]</ref>.</s><s>If microbial community changes occur in a way that effectively decreases microbial support to plants, functional trait differences could emerge as plants compensate for the loss of microbial relationships.</s><s>Further studies are necessary to understand how nutrient enrichment impacts microbial communities and their plant associations in coastal soils.</s></p><p><s>Surprisingly, we found that different patterns emerged depending on whether we analyzed trait-based composition, species composition, or lifeform abundance.</s><s>As hypothesized, trait-based community analysis provided evidence that N and NP treatments filter trait combinations that favor survival when biomass is high (i.e., in biotically competitive scenarios).</s><s>Directional divergence of communities experiencing different nutrient enrichment treatments (in multivariate trait space) indicates the importance of incorporating multiple aboveground trait combinations when investigating drivers of trait-based community composition.</s><s>In contrast with these trait-based patterns, we uncovered distinct differences in species composition among our nutrient treatments, such that all communities were significantly different from one another, while abundance of different lifeforms in each treatment community exhibit yet another pattern, in which all treatments were similar in relative forb and graminoid cover.</s><s>Contrasting patterns between trait, species, and lifeform response presents an important complexity that has lacked focus in nutrient enrichment studies.</s><s>It is critical to determine how each type of community investigation technique contributes to our understanding of plant community response to nutrient enrichment.</s><s>While we did not specifically test why these community-level analyses differ in their response to nutrient enrichment, we recognize that contrasting patterns among trait, species, and lifeform analyses could be relevant to questions that are currently being pursued in other investigations of plant community response to nutrient enrichment.</s><s>For this reason, we highlight two possible explanations for such community responses below and encourage future work emphasizing these points.</s></p><p><s>First, these patterns could indicate that nutrient enrichment influences functional traits, species composition, and lifeform abundance independently.</s><s>For example, it is possible that functional trait responses would not match species composition changes if nutrient treatments are not causing complete species turnover.</s><s>Global change drivers like nutrient enrichment can influence species composition in a plethora of ways including species rank and evenness changes <ref target="#b75" type="bibr">[76]</ref>.</s><s>If differences in species composition among nutrient treatments are caused by reordering of subordinate species or increased dominance of the most abundant species, we may not see differences reflected in community level functional traits because the dominant species still contribute most to the community functional trait expression.</s></p><p><s>Second, to fully understand how nutrient additions impact plant communities, it is of interest to determine whether altered functional trait expressions lead to changes in species composition, or vice versa.</s><s>In our coastal grassland system, it is possible that functional traits, species composition, and lifeform abundance may change sequentially.</s><s>Such a phenomenon could exist because nutrient additions play a critical role in increasing biomass production which consequentially changes plant competitive interactions through modified functional traits of community members.</s><s>This mechanism leads to competitive exclusion of certain species under a new highly productive community, resulting in altered species composition.</s><s>However, the inverse relationship could also be true.</s><s>Nutrients could reorganize species abundances by opening a niche space for species that would otherwise be unable to germinate and colonize a given resources space, resulting in new plant species contributing to community-level functional trait compositions.</s><s>Given these complexities, we encourage the use of other community-level functional trait metrics to disentangle changes in functional trait compositions, like functional alpha-and beta-diversity which we tested at our coastal grassland site.</s></p><p><s>We did not find that functional alpha-diversity varied significantly among nutrient treatments.</s><s>However, we did find a significant positive correlation signifying that functional alpha-diversity is coupled with increased biomass production which is caused by N and NP enrichment.</s><s>The coupled response of biomass and functional alpha-diversity response is likely a critical piece in identifying mechanisms of local-scale co-existence.</s><s>In this case, when biomass is high, competitive interactions result in dissimilar trait values for co-occurring species at the alpha-level <ref target="#b76" type="bibr">[77]</ref>.</s><s>However, it is surprising that the pattern of increased alpha-diversity was only seen in relation to biomass and not among different nutrient enrichment treatments.</s><s>This pattern may indicate an indirect influence of nutrient enrichment on functional diversity at the alpha-level.</s><s>For example, nutrient enrichment may have an influence on specific functional trait responses, but the diversity of traits at the plot level are more influenced by biomass productivity.</s><s>This information supports that functional diversity at the alpha-level can help determine how modified functional trait expressions influence species compositions as varying nutrient treatments increase biomass production.</s><s>Similar findings have been found in other grassland communities <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">[47]</ref>.</s></p></div>
