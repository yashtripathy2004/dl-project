<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Introduction<p><s>The construction industry faces many challenges to reduce its environmental impacts, including reducing the volume of construction waste, and particularly the volume of waste sent to landfill.</s><s>In Europe, excavated soils are the largest stream of construction waste, estimated to be \ 500 MT/year <ref target="#b0" type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</s><s>In the UK, there is a target to reduce excavation soil sent to landfill by 75% by 2040, and zero soil to landfill by 2050 <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Whilst some of this material can be reused for geotechnical activities elsewhere on site, transportation of excavated soil to landfill is still a common practice <ref target="#b2" type="bibr">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Volumes of excavated material are particularly large for major infrastructure projects involving tunnelling-hundreds of megatonnes of excavated material are forecast to be generated over the next 50 years <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Where excavation is carried out in urban areas, transport of excavated soil out of the site can add disruption to local residents.</s><s>The overall management of excavated soil can be improved by increasing their use in construction materials <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Another challenge is to reduce the embodied carbon of construction, with particular scrutiny on concrete.</s><s>In the UK, the Low Carbon Concrete Group roadmap targets net zero emissions from concrete production by 2050, with at least a 50% reduction to be achieved by 2030 <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">[6]</ref>.</s><s>One of the fastest ways to decrease the carbon footprint of cement is to decrease the clinker content with higher substitutions of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Blast furnace slag and fly ash remain the most commonly used SCMs in the UK.</s><s>However, falling domestic supply and an increased reliance on imports are expected to reduce supply chain resilience and increase prices in the coming years <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref>.</s><s>The use of calcined clay in binary and ternary forms (with limestone) has the potential to reduce the CO 2 footprint of cementitious materials between 30 and 50% compared to Portland clinker <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">[9]</ref><ref target="#b9" type="bibr">[10]</ref><ref target="#b10" type="bibr">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, calcined clays produced from clays with low purity and/or mixed clay mineralogy are increasingly being explored as an alternative to conventional SCMs.</s><s>However, their variation in purity and mineralogy raises questions around selection of calcination conditions to promote optimum reactivity, how the properties of such calcined clays might influence fresh, mechanical or long-term performance of concretes produced with them, compared with materials produced with other SCMs.</s></p><p><s>The use of excavated clayed soils as a SCM offers an opportunity for the construction industry to address the mentioned challenges simultaneously.</s><s>Design of mobile calcining plants for clays or soils has been proposed <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12,</ref><ref target="#b12" type="bibr">13]</ref>.</s><s>However, an integrated calcining, grinding and blending plant on-site has not yet been implemented on any major construction operations.</s><s>An innovative mobile clay processing facility is currently under development as part of a major infrastructure project in the UK <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref>.</s><s>This set-up would have numerous benefits in principle, including reducing the volume of excavated material sent to landfill; improving the functional value of soils, relative to use in groundworks or landfill; reducing the flow of materials entering and leaving the construction site, and reducing the impact of truck traffic on the neighbourhood.</s><s>There is increasing research interest in adopting resource recovery principles in the construction lifecycle in order to reduce environmental impacts <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>; however, excavated clays have received little attention so far.</s></p><p><s>Several routes for valorisation for excavation waste have been investigated, which include the developed of supplementary cementitious materials <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref><ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref><ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref>, as fine aggregates <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">[5,</ref><ref target="#b18" type="bibr">19]</ref>, for development of earth-based materials <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20,</ref><ref target="#b20" type="bibr">21]</ref>, as precursors of alkali-activated cements production <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref> and as raw feeds for calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cements production or as CSA replacements <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23,</ref><ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24]</ref>.</s><s>Wherever possible, excavation wastes should be used as raw material in earth construction due to the low embodied carbon of the process, however, experience has shown that excavation management is a common problem in major infrastructure projects, particularly in densely populated areas, e.g., an artificial island was created from waste from a past major infrastructure <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This study investigated the feasibility of producing SCMs using excavated material from ongoing tunnelling works in the Greater London region, whilst the excavated material predominately consists of London Clay formation.</s><s>These works are linked to the first part of High Speed 2 (HS2, https://www.hs2.org.uk), a major rail infrastructure project in the UK <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref> and it is estimated that over 5 million m 3 of material will be excavated-the majority of this is expected to be London Clay <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>London Clay is the name given to the type of clays found in the London Basin geological formation.</s><s>They are mixed, or common, clays-their clay mineral assemblage typically consists of smectite, illite, kaolinite and chlorite <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref>.</s><s>This diversity within the clay mineral fraction makes London Clays mineralogically distinct from kaolinitic clays, which have received most attention within the field of calcined clays as SCMs.</s><s>Crucially, their kaolinite content is relatively low-broadly within the range of 10-30 wt% <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref>.</s><s>This is believed to be disadvantageous from an SCM production perspective, as 40 wt% of kaolinite content has previously been established as the optimal amount required <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[28,</ref><ref target="#b28" type="bibr">29]</ref> to produce blended cements with equivalent strength development by 7 days to that of Portland cement systems.</s><s>However, the extent to which the other, less reactive clay minerals typically present in London Clays (i.e.</s><s>smectite, illite, chlorite) may contribute to reactivity is still an open research question.</s></p><p><s>Non-kaolinitic clay minerals are also known to exhibit pozzolanic reactivity once calcined, however, they are typically less reactive than metakaolin <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[30]</ref><ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[31]</ref><ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[32]</ref><ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Recent work on common clays from Germany determined that smectite and interstratified illite-smectite make a tangible contribution to overall reactivity <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[34]</ref>.</s><s>The only peer-reviewed study so far specifically on the use of London Clays as SCMs found that calcination at 900 °C for 2 h gave the best reactivity performance at 14 days and beyond, as measured by the Frattini test, portlandite consumption measurements and strength activity index; however, these findings are related to clays calcined in 5 cm diameter pellets in laboratory scale.</s><s>Concretes with 30 wt% replacement using London Clay calcined at 900 °C developed sufficient workability (i.e., Slump class 2, 50-90 mm slump) and a satisfactory performance in terms of 90-day compressive strength <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Another study on clays with \ 20 wt% kaolinite content from a variety of UK geological formations (but not including the London Clay formation) deemed them to be promising as potential SCMs <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Whilst the small amount of literature on the use of London Clays as SCMs shows promise, more research is needed in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the links between mineralogy, calcination conditions, and performance in cementitious systems.</s></p><p><s>Beyond the role of the clay minerals, the associated minerals typically found in London clays also present challenges including ensuring that sulphur-bearing phases (e.g.</s><s>pyrite) in the as-received material do not pose a durability threat after calcination, and ensuring that carbonate minerals (e.g.</s><s>calcite, dolomite) do not decompose to form problematic amounts of expansive phases (e.g.</s><s>free lime, periclase).</s><s>Free lime and MgO are also known to cause expansion due to crystallization of calcium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[36,</ref><ref target="#b36" type="bibr">37]</ref>.</s><s>Provided that calcination conditions are sufficient to cause complete thermal decomposition of iron sulphide phases, then their presence in an asreceived clay is not problematic <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[38]</ref>.</s><s>Aside from associated minerals, it is feasible that remnants of polymer foams used for facilitating excavation may be present in excavated material.</s><s>It is important to assess the calcined excavated materials to ensure that no such materials remain which might have a detrimental effect on use in concrete.</s></p><p><s>In this study three different sample locations of excavated London Clay were investigated.</s><s>These materials were selected to indicate the extent of variability of the spoils being generated from HS2 excavation works in the Greater London area.</s><s>Detailed characterisation of the clayed soils was conducted using a multi-technique approach including X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), quantitative X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and thermogravimetry analysis coupled with mass spectrometry (TG-MS).</s><s>Different calcination conditions were applied to these materials in order to enhance their chemical reactivity, which was determined by the R 3 testing method.</s><s>Changes in the mineralogy and structure of the excavated materials upon thermal treatment were evaluated applying similar techniques to those used for characterising the raw clays.</s></p><p><s>Blended Portland paste mixes were optimised (gypsum adjustment) and produced with high replacement levels (50 and 70 wt%) using selected calcined clays.</s><s>The kinetics of reaction of these mixes were determined using isothermal calorimetry.</s><s>Compressive strength testing in mortars specimens was also conducted.</s></p></div>

minerals during calcination.</s><s>However, this should not be extrapolated as a universal finding across mixed clays.</s><s>For clays with a high content of carbonates and a lower content of clay minerals, it may be the case that a slightly lower calcination temperature is more favourable on balance.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Blend cement formulations optimisation<p><s>A high volume replacement of CEM I with SCMs is known to create a sulphate demand due to additional aluminates and surface area introduced by the SCM that affect early age hydration kinetics of clinker phases <ref target="#b62" type="bibr">[64]</ref><ref target="#b63" type="bibr">[65]</ref><ref target="#b64" type="bibr">[66]</ref>.</s><s>Hence it is important to check for sulphate demand to ensure blends prepared with calcined London Clay is formulated to ensure maximum reaction potential at early age.</s><s>The heat flow curves for the CC50 (Fig. <ref target="#fig_6" type="figure">11a</ref>) and CC70 (Fig. <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">12a</ref>) series both exhibited a similar trend-the aluminate peak shifted to later times with increasing gypsum content.</s><s>At 24 h, the pastes with 1 wt% gypsum exhibited the highest heat flow values for both CC50 and CC70 series.</s><s>The heat release values were lower for the CC70 series due to higher replacement level of CEM I. Values of cumulative heat at 24 h were also marginally highest for the 1wt% gypsum addition (Fig. <ref target="#fig_7" type="figure">13</ref>).</s><s>It would therefore be expected that the 1 wt% gypsum addition blends would exhibit higher 1-day strength.</s><s>The gypsum demand did not change with the increase in replacement level from 50 to 70 wt%.</s><s>This is mainly due to the relatively low metakaolin content of the industrially calcined Westgate clay.</s></p><p><s>The optimised gypsum addition for both CC50 and CC70 was therefore identified to be 1 wt%.</s><s>Setting time measurements were carried out for both these optimised blends (i.e.</s><s>CC50-G1 and CC70-G1), and compared to CEM I (Fig. <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">14</ref>).</s><s>The setting window for CC50-G1 and CC70-G1 is 6-8 h.</s><s>CC70-G1 is marginally faster setting than CC50-G1, and both blends exhibit noticeably accelerated setting relative to CEM I despite a delay in heat release observed from calorimetry.</s><s>In this case, normliased heat flow per gram of Portland cement was able to confirm the acceleration in reaction kinetics; although heat flow per gram of paste does not showcase any acceleration of reaction.</s><s>Similar reduction in setting time has been observed with other calcined clays in previous studies, attributed to the addition of calcined clay increasing the cohesivity of the mixes and heterogenous nucleation of calcium aluminosilicate hydrate (C-A-S-H) on fine calcined clay particles at early ages <ref target="#b65" type="bibr">[67]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Compressive strength development<p><s>The compressive strength values (Fig. <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">15</ref>).</s><s>were consistently lower for the CC70 series, compared to the CC50 series.</s><s>As expected, increased w/b ratio resulted in a decrease in compressive strength, across both replacement levels.</s><s>The addition of calcined clay often contributes to strength increase within 7 days of curing <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[29,</ref><ref target="#b66" type="bibr">68,</ref><ref target="#b67" type="bibr">69]</ref>, and the results reported here are consistent with what has been observed in other calcined clays blended systems <ref target="#b65" type="bibr">[67]</ref>.</s><s>However, it is worth mentioning that all these studies have reported minimal strength development after 28 days while with calcined London Clay there is considerable strength development after 28 days, probably due to the slower reactivity.</s><s>The rich variety inherent in naturally occurring clay resources offers numereous potential for SCM production; but it also presents challenges.</s><s>On the one hand, this study shows that 800 °C is an effective calcination temperature for London Clays, in terms of reactivity performance and avoiding potentially problematic mineral phases.</s><s>However, it is also highlighted that care is needed in characterisation work and decision-making.</s><s>Whilst XRD and TG are techniques familiar to those in the cement industry, quantifying the presence of 2:1 clay minerals and a range of associated minerals is not straightforward.</s><s>R 3 reactivity cumulative heat results showcase the chemical reactivity of calcined excavated London Clay.</s><s>Its potential as a material suitable for SCM usage was validated by the compressive strength development of blended cements produced with them.</s></p><p><s>London Clay samples from three different locations displayed very similarly behaviour, despite being sourced several kilometres away from each other.</s><s>Whilst geological surveys can offer valuable insights into the expected mineralogy of excavated material in a given area, detailed characterisation is still necessary for quality control.</s><s>Whilst many of the principles around characterisation and selection of calcination temperature are more-or-less universal, these formation-specific findings of the present stuidy on London Clay cannot be transferred wholesale to other geological resources (e.g., Oxford Clays, Etruvia Marls) without further validation.</s><s>The R 3 results showed that the 2:1 clay minerals present in London Clays react Error bars correspond to one standard deviation more slowly than conventional kaolinitic clays, and that they may be making a non-negligible contribution to reactivity at 7 days and possibly beyond.</s><s>Therefore, it is recommended to extend the R 3 testing duration to 14 days for these type clays, to avoid underestimating the true potential chemical reactivity of these materials.</s></p><p><s>Compressive strength results from optimised blended formulations indicate that high levels of CEM I substitution (up to 70 wt%) by calcined London Clays are achievable for the potential production of concretes of different strength grades.</s><s>Work is currently underway to develop further understanding on designing blended cements, and conducting concrete mixes trials using calcined London Clay SCM.</s><s>Whilst low-risk applications will be the starting point for concretes made with calcined London Clay, durability monitoring in natural exposure conditions will still be essential for validating performance of these concretes in service.</s></p><p><s>The notion of 'technological robustness' will be critical to the use of excavated materials for calcined clay production.</s><s>The flexibility and versatility of onsite production is highly attractive as an agile approach to waste minimisation and valorisation.</s><s>However, this alternative production model, in contrast to centralised, static production at a large clay deposit, has the flipside of more attention needed to characterising the excavated materials and their variability to control the quality of the materials produced from different construction sites.</s></p></div><figure xml:id="fig_0" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Fig. 1<label>1</label><figdesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Locations of HS2 construction sites within Greater London from where samples of excavated material were sourced</s></p></div></figdesc><graphic coords="4,106.07,59.24,334.98,181.70" type="bitmap"></graphic></figure>
