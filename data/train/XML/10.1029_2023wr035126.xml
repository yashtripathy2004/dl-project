<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Conclusion<p><s>Understanding factors controlling summer low flow across the western US is critical for low-flow prediction and water allocation.</s><s>Models often use climate parameters to predict low-flow discharge, and while they consistently perform well at snow-dominated sites, they tend to perform poorly at rain-dominated sites.</s><s>We used multiple linear regression to compare predictors of low-flow discharge at three sites across the western US spanning snow dominance and varying proportions of dynamic versus deep subsurface storage.</s><s>We not only leveraged the commonly used suite of climate parameters (e.g., peak SWE, melt rate, and snowfall fraction) but also included lagged hydrodynamics to reflect the influence of previous year snowpack and streamflow.</s><s>We introduce RLGW as a new metric that provides insight into melt processes through capturing the surface water-groundwater dynamics during melt season.</s><s>We found that lagged hydrodynamics and RLGW were strong predictors of summer low flow across all three sites and improved predictions of summer low flow at a rain-dominated watershed.</s><s>Furthermore, the degree to which summer low flow is predicted by RLGW may be mediated by the proportion of dynamic to deep storage.</s><s>In systems with more dynamic than deep storage, RLGW is likely a better predictor of summer low flow because the stream is more responsive to flow contribution from the dynamic storage zone compared to a deep storage-dominated systems.</s><s>Overall, what emerges is that including indicators of same year and previous year groundwater dynamics improves low-flow predictions, but the strength of these predictors is tied to subsurface storage.</s><s>Although we only look at three sites, it is a step toward improving low-flow models.</s><s>In the future, similar methods could be applied to many sites across the west.</s></p></div><figure xml:id="fig_0" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Figure 1 .<label>1</label><figdesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Location of each watershed (a) with colors indicating average 1 April snow water equivalent (SWE) between 2004 and 2020 from Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) across the western US.</s><s>Individual watershed maps of Lookout Creek (b), Sagehen Creek (c), and Coal Creek (d).</s><s>The black line indicates the mainstem of each creek.</s><s>The white triangle is the location where the chemistry data are collected, and the black square is the US Geological Survey (USGS) gage associated with each stream.</s><s>Background colors represent the underlying lithology sourced from State Geologic Map Compilation<ref target="#b38" type="bibr">(Horton et al., 2017)</ref>.</s></p></div></figdesc><graphic coords="4,52.71,89.02,494.52,293.16" type="bitmap"></graphic></figure>
