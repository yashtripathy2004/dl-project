Adult worms reside in the conjunctiva and surrounding structures of their definitive host, causing a range of clinical outcomes from asymptomatic carriage through to severe ocular pathology including blepharitis, conjunctivitis and corneal ulceration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In recent years, <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> appears to have spread rapidly through Europe: since 2003 the list of endemic countries has expanded from Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], where autochthonous transmission was first recorded in Europe, to include France, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Greece, Slovakia and Serbia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Zoonotic infections have been diagnosed in endemic regions of Europe on several occasions, demonstrating the importance of its spread to public health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To date, DNA sequence analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase&#x000a0;subunit 1 (<italic>cox</italic>1) gene performed on specimens collected from several different host species across Europe has demonstrated presence of a single haplotype (h1). This suggests spread of <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> in Europe has occurred from a single introduction event and/or that this haplotype (h1) is well adapted for survival and transmission in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Travel of companion animals between European countries provides an opportunity for further dissemination of <italic>T. callipaeda</italic>. For example, in 2016 patent infections were imported to the UK on at least two occasions in animals with a history of travel to <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> endemic areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], whilst the introduction of the parasite to Spain is thought to have occurred through the importation of infected hunting dogs from Italy and France [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, zoonotic infections acquired during travel abroad may also facilitate the introduction of <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> to non-endemic countries on a global scale, emphasising the need for a &#x0201c;One Health&#x0201d; approach for the surveillance of such disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">A critical determinant of <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> spread and distribution is the presence of intermediate host species. In Europe, males of <italic>Phortica variegata</italic> (Drosophilidae: Steganinae) are intermediate hosts and vectors under natural conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These flies are typically associated with oak (<italic>Quercus</italic> spp.) woodland habitats and fruit farms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and primarily feed on fermenting sap runs and fruit. Additionally (and importantly), males exhibit zoophagic behaviour, feeding on the lacrimal secretions of humans and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It is through this behaviour that male flies transmit <italic>T. callipaeda</italic>, becoming infected through the ingestion of L1 larvae when feeding on infected hosts, and depositing infective L3 larvae onto the eyes of new definitive hosts when they feed again. Development from L1 to L3 occurs on the surface of testes of the fly, at which point infective L3 larvae migrate to the oesophagus and proboscis to be transmitted to a definitive host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This process typically takes 14&#x02013;21 days from the point of ingestion. In southern Europe, flies are active from May to October with optimal temperatures (20&#x02013;25 &#x000b0;C) and humidity (50&#x02013;70%) present in July and August leading to greater activity and likelihood for <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> transmission at this time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Ecological niche modelling in 2006 demonstrated that the potential distribution of <italic>P. variegata</italic> ranged widely across southern and central Europe, extending as far north as Denmark, the southern tip of Sweden and south-eastern England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Whilst <italic>P. variegata</italic> is present in the UK, it is currently listed as a species of conservation concern under Section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. There have, however, been a number of observations of this species in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Additionally, questions exist concerning its biology and ecology in the UK including the length of its active flying season. Understanding both geographical distribution and the length of flying season of <italic>P. variegata</italic> are of importance when evaluating the potential for <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> introduction to the UK and the likelihood of autochthonous transmission occurring, especially in wild carnivores such as foxes.</p><p id="Par14">The aim of this study was to re-visit the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP) model analysis described by Otranto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] to predict ecological niche distribution for <italic>P. variegata</italic> across Europe using updated climate data and <italic>P. variegata</italic> records. This is important given recent climate change trends in Europe and the UK. Furthermore, to help determine whether autochthonous transmission of <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> might occur, particular consideration was given to the UK through fine-scale mapping and field sampling for model validation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ecological niche modelling</title><p id="Par15">GPS co-ordinates were obtained from European records [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and derived from the UK literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

For European models, spatial datasets for fixed variables included mapped altitude (m) and slope from the ETOPO1 dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], meteorological records (1959&#x02013;2015) for annual mean rainfall (mm), temperature (&#x000b0;C), diurnal temperature range or DTR (&#x000b0;C), wet days (defined as days above 1&#x000a0;mm rainfall), potential evapotranspiration or PET (mm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and solar irradiance (W/m<sup>2</sup>) derived from satellite estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].

Finer scale mapping of <italic>P. variegata</italic> distribution in the UK (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) showed it was likely to be limited to the south and east of England.

Furthermore, evidence of active sap runs were detected on some trees and at one location a commercial apple orchard was also found in the immediate vicinity (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). All six locations had public footpaths. Owners were regularly observed walking their dogs through these areas. A single male <italic>P. variegata</italic> was caught at one location where <italic>P. variegata</italic> had been documented previously (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), but no nematode larvae were detected following dissection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par25">Our study updates the ecological niche model by Otranto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], which was based on 240 known locations of <italic>P. variegata</italic> from across Europe and used climatic data from 1960&#x02013;1990. Subsequent reports of autochthonous transmission in multiple European countries in the intervening period have proven the validity of that approach, namely determining the ecological and environmental conditions suitable for <italic>P. variegata</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In the current study, ecological niche model analysis using up to date climate information and 71 new <italic>P. variegata</italic> locations indicates the potential for further introduction of <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> to new regions of Europe, including the UK.</p><p id="Par26">The ecological niche models presented here for Europe are largely in agreement with those described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], but suggest an increase in the distribution range of <italic>P. variegata</italic> eastward to include new regions of the Ukraine, Turkey and Russia. To date, autochthonous transmission of <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> in Europe has been limited to a single haplotype (h1), in contrast there are at least twenty additional haplotypes present in southeast Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Recent phylogenetic analysis of <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> isolates identified a divergence between European h1 and those haplotypes present in Asian countries during the Pleistocene epoch, suggesting two separate sub-populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The presence of just a single haplotype in Europe may be the result of either a specific genetic adaption of <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> h1 which enables its survival and propagation in Europe, or an indication that its spread in Europe was the result of a single introduction of <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> h1 to the continent. If the latter is true, expansion of <italic>P. variegata</italic> range eastward increases the likelihood of further introductions of <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> from Asia, including new haplotypes with unknown consequences for the biology and epidemiology of <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> in Europe, specifically its prevalence, incidence and zoonotic potential.</p><p id="Par27">GARP model analysis suggests the most suitable areas for <italic>P. variegata</italic> in the UK are in southeast England. In many instances these regions intersect with national parks such as the New Forest, Windsor Forest, Wye Valley, South Downs and parts of the Kent Downs; many of these locations are popular areas for dog walking. This scenario could bring competent definitive and intermediate hosts of <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> into close proximity. If dogs infected with <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> as a result of travel to endemic European regions are exercised in such areas, autochthonous transmission to <italic>P. variegata</italic> in the UK is a possibility. Furthermore, such national parks are home to numerous sylvatic species (e.g. red foxes, hares and rabbits) which are themselves competent definitive wild hosts for <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This readily available wildlife reservoir further increases the possibility of <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> becoming established in the UK.</p><p id="Par28">The single male <italic>P. variegata</italic> specimen collected was not infected with <italic>T. callipaeda</italic>. However, given that the infection rate in <italic>P. variegata</italic> is ~1% under natural conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] the probability of detecting autochthonous transmission by this method is very low. For surveillance purposes, a more realistic approach would be to passively monitor <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> infection in sylvatic species in regions where <italic>P. variegata</italic> presence is already known.</p><p id="Par29">Overlaying the UK map as a layer in Google Earth Pro&#x000ae; allowed the identification of potential <italic>P. variegata</italic> sites by locating areas of woodland within these hotspot areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This approach demonstrates a major advantage of ecological niche modelling, since it facilitates a more targeted approach to both field sampling for <italic>P. variegata</italic> and surveillance for autochthonous <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> transmission. Whilst we were unable to confirm <italic>P. variegata</italic> presence in locations predicted by the new GARP model, we were able to identify habitat suitable for the species, specifically extensive <italic>Quercus</italic> spp. woodland. The inclement weather conditions (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and relative lateness in the season for sampling may have hindered our detection of <italic>P. variegata</italic> even if they were present. Further field sampling at such sites in summer months would help establish the presence or absence of <italic>P. variegata</italic> more definitively. Additional observations could then be incorporated into updated versions of the UK GARP model for <italic>P. variegata</italic> distribution to improve its accuracy, or derive risk maps on a per month basis.</p><p id="Par30">The vector competence of <italic>P. variegata</italic> from geographical areas where <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> is not yet present, such as the USA, has been recently demonstrated under laboratory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], confirming the potential for autochthonous transmission in areas where the parasite is not endemic but the vector occurs, such as the UK. We have confirmed that, under favourable climatic conditions, adult <italic>P. variegata</italic> were still active in the UK in the last week of August. Falk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] noted previously that <italic>P. variegata</italic> activity in the UK was observed in June and July, but that the full extent of their active flying season was unknown. Current evidence would suggest an active flying season in the south of the UK from May through to September [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Importantly, with respect to its role as a vector of <italic>T. callipaeda</italic>, this would enable transmission in the UK to occur within a single flying season, since the minimum time required for development of first-stage larvae to infective third-stage larvae is 14&#x02013;21 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">The ability of infected <italic>P. variegata</italic> to successfully overwinter has been demonstrated experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Additionally, <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> L3 and L4 larvae recovered from <italic>P. variegata</italic> and dogs, respectively, at the beginning of the active flying season suggesting delayed transmission to the following flying year is possible under natural conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In cooler northern latitudes the ability of infected <italic>P. variegata</italic> to overwinter may prove to be an important additional feature in determining whether such fly populations are capable of sustaining autochthonous transmission of <italic>T. callipaeda</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par32">By updating and developing ecological niche models of <italic>P. variegata</italic> distribution across Europe and the UK, respectively, we have confirmed its predicted range and indicate the potential for expansion to new regions. In the UK, this has implications with respect to the potential for autochthonous transmission of <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> following its introduction from mainland Europe. Passive surveillance of sylvatic species is suggested to monitor for autochthonous <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> transmission. In addition, research to determine and improve the accuracy of GARP models and/or introduce temporal components to consider seasonal and annual range variation would further help monitor the distribution of <italic>P. variegata</italic> and the subsequent risk of <italic>T. callipaeda</italic> infection to both human and animal populations.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>GARP</term><def><p id="Par5">Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>JNCC</term><def><p id="Par6">Joint Nature Conservation Committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIHR</term><def><p id="Par7">National Institute for Health Research</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UK</term><def><p id="Par8">United Kingdom (of Great Britain and Northern Ireland)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>USA</term><def><p id="Par9">United States of America</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Mr Steven Falk for his helpful advice and expertise in UK <italic>P. variegata</italic> locations, Professor Matthew Baylis and Mr Kenneth Sherlock for their advice and the kind provision of trapping equipment for field work and Dr John McGarry for the kind provision of dichotomous identification keys<bold>.</bold> We would like to thank the Mett Office for providing EOBS data and the NIHR.
