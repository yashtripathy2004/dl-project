<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Weak Bimaterial Contrast<p><s>The strong material contrast spanned three orders of magnitude.</s><s>Now, the S-wave velocities are on the same order of magnitude: 6.9 ± 1 m s -1 (lower gel) and 3.2 ± 1 m s -1 (upper gel).</s><s>However the effective speeds during the rupture might be different due to local heterogeneities and gel dehydration.</s><s>We observe two types of slip events on the weak bimaterial contrast interface: propagating ruptures and localized wave radiations (see Movie S2).</s></p><p><s>A rupture that appears to propagate below shear and Rayleigh wave speed is shown in Figure <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">4a</ref>.</s><s>Figures <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">4c</ref> and<ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">4d</ref> show the corresponding 1D waveforms at specified depth-and time-steps in the upper halfspace.</s><s>In both displays, the right-traveling front exhibits higher amplitudes than the left-traveling one.</s><s>This front also exposes a smaller angle to the vertical (inclination difference), indicating a speed difference between the fronts.</s><s>A straightforward explanation is a sub-Rayleigh rupture traveling in positive x-direction, the slip direction of the more compliant (upper) gel.</s><s>A wavefront of continuous polarity throughout both half-spaces exists in the rupture propagation direction.</s></p><p><s>We model the radiation with a rightwards moving DC of constant sub-Rayleigh velocity (Figure <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">S13</ref> in Supporting Information S1).</s><s>The simulated wavefield (Figures <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">4b, 4e,</ref> and<ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">4f</ref>) reproduces the continuous polarity across the interface.</s><s>In contrast, the radiation pattern of a UF exhibits alternating polarities (Figure <ref type="figure">S9</ref> in Supporting Information S1).</s><s>However, similar to the case of a strong bimaterial contrast, the leading NF lobe predicted by the DC solution is not identified in the experimental data.</s><s>Figure <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">4a</ref>) reveals that a weak upwards polarized zone is present at interface depth, but quickly disappears elsewhere.</s><s>This could be an imprint of the NF getting masked by the continuous deformation of the gel (see Movie S2, (Figures <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">4</ref> and<ref target="#fig_6" type="figure">5</ref> start at approximately 2,396 ms),).</s><s>Note that the amplitude increase in the rupture direction is more pronounced in the simulation than in the experiment.</s><s>Shear wave attenuation could mask the amplitude difference between the wave fronts in rupture and opposite rupture direction, but is neglected in the kinematic simulation.</s><s>Furthermore, the laboratory rupture might be shorter than the qualitatively simulated rupture of Figure <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">4b</ref>.</s><s>For strong contrast experiments we as well as <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">(Latour et al., 2011</ref><ref target="#b21" type="bibr">(Latour et al., , 2013) )</ref> only observed supershear ruptures.</s><s>For homogeneous systems, rupture propagation at sub-Rayleigh speed is expected <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">(Shlomai &amp; Fineberg, 2016</ref>), but had not been observed by shear wave imaging prior to this experiment, which provides the first dynamic US observation of a gel-gel rupture <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">(Latour et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>However, we do not exclude the possibility that supershear ruptures may also exist in this case.</s><s>Situated 3 milliseconds after Figure <ref target="#fig_5" type="figure">4</ref> and 5a shows a localized event with a quadripolar radiation pattern.</s><s>The radiation is qualitatively reproduced as the NF lobe of a unidirectional point force model, which is shown in Figure <ref target="#fig_6" type="figure">5b</ref>.</s><s>The source rise time is several ms long (see Figure <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">S13</ref> in Supporting Information S1).</s><s>Contrary to the localized event on the strong bimaterial contrast interface, the far-field part of the theoretical radiation is not observed.</s><s>Instead, the event is followed by a left-going rupture, shown in Figure <ref target="#fig_6" type="figure">5c</ref> (event 3 in Figure <ref type="figure">S8</ref> in Supporting Information S1).</s><s>A similar sequence occurs at 2,350 ms in Movie S2.</s><s>We hypothesize that the long rise-time localized event corresponds to the nucleation process of the subsequent rupture.</s><s>An apparent aseismic lateral displacement of the radiation pattern in the lower half space for the experimental data remains of unclear origin.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Relevance for Natural Rupture Processes<p><s>For the strong bimaterial contrast, we find that microslip as well as rupture radiations are better described by a unique force model than by a DC model.</s><s>This is intuitively understood as the consequence of the strong elasticity contrast at the interface: the UF corresponds to the relaxation of the gel's loading force when friction drops at the interface.</s></p><p><s>In nature, strong material contrasts are encountered in environmental seismology, that is, for landslides and glacier stick-slip.</s><s>Both processes exhibit a wet granular layer and a compliant mass sliding on a hard bedrock.</s><s>Our granular asperity is conceptually comparable to glacial till <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">(Gräff et al., 2021)</ref>, and the "sticky spot" encountered in alpine glacial stick-slip <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">(Umlauft et al., 2021)</ref>.</s><s>Unidirectional force models for strong material contrasts have been proposed for the 1980 Mt.
