Unfortunately, AC cannot regenerate spontaneously; therefore, several treatments have been developed for AC regeneration, including cell-based therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is one of the promising cell-based therapies for regeneration of AC defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, ACI still has several challenges. Chondrocytes cultured in vitro undergo dedifferentiation, causing fibro-cartilage like remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, the extracellular matrix (ECM) around the implanted chondrocytes needs enough maturation time for constructing firm structures to resist load bearing and takes a long time (8&#x02013;12&#x000a0;weeks) to obtain full weight bearing capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In order to enhance ECM synthesis and maturation, microenvironmental factors such as the presence of growth factors, scaffolds, oxygen tension, and mechanical stimuli have been intensively investigated for several decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition to these factors, we recently proposed the importance of temperature for ECM synthesis by chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Because the temperature within the human knee joint is influenced by environmental temperature, the mean temperature of the human knee joint is approximately 32&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, which is 4&#x02013;5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C lower than the inner body temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. We reported that culture temperatures affected ECM synthesis of chondrocytes in a three-dimensional (3-D) pellet culture system using adult human chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and found that a culture temperature of 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C was superior to that of 32&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for ECM synthesis. This indicates that temperature modulation could be used as a treatment to enhance ECM synthesis and maturation for ACI. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies investigating the effects of periodic heat stimuli on the ECM synthesis of AC in human chondrocytes. Here we hypothesized that periodic mild heat stimuli enhance ECM synthesis in adult human chondrocytes. This study aimed to clarify the effects of periodic mild heat stimuli on ECM synthesis of adult human chondrocytes in a 3-D pellet culture system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Main text</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Chondrocyte isolation</title><p id="Par16">Human chondrocytes were isolated from the articular cartilage of a femoral head extracted during a bipolar hip arthroplasty on an 89-year-old woman using a previously described method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

We performed an additional experiment to confirm the effects of different temperature stimulus, and found that there were no positive effects of heat stimulus at 41&#x02013;45&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 20&#x000a0;min on the expression of ECM-related mRNAs in pellet-cultured chondrocytes (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par26">Biochemical assessment of the collagen and proteoglycan content per cell showed that collagen accumulation per cell was diminished in the 32&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C&#x02009;+&#x02009;Heat group. This would indicate that collagen synthesis was inhibited at the translational or post-translational level, but not at the transcription level, because there was no significant difference in the mRNA expression of COL2A1 and ACAN between the 32&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C group and the 32&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C&#x02009;+&#x02009;Heat group. It is reported that the triple-helix conformation of collagen cannot be formed at around 40&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition, the DNA content in the 32&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C&#x02009;+&#x02009;Heat group was significantly lower than that in the other groups, indicating cell loss in the 32&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C&#x02009;+&#x02009;Heat group. We previously reported cell loss in the pellet culture system with continuous heat stimulation at 41&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], whereas little cell loss was observed in a monolayer culture system at the same temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In our previous study, we mentioned that prolonged exposure to heat stimulation may have a negative effect, and that periodic heat stimulation may have a positive effect on ECM formation. However, the present study indicates that mild heat stimuli might diminish collagen synthesis and cause cell loss even if applied in a periodic manner. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the effect of heat stimuli on ECM synthesis using several microenvironmental conditions as well as implanted chondrocytes in vivo before applying heat stimuli for a clinical trial of ACI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par27">Here we investigated the effects of periodic mild heat stimuli on ECM synthesis of adult human chondrocytes in a 3-D pellet culture system. Our results indicated that periodic mild heat stimuli could diminish ECM synthesis due to inhibition of the collagen production and loss of cells. Although application of a heat stimulus to enhance chondrocyte ECM synthesis would have potential as a method for ACI treatment, there are also associated risks as we indicate here. Further research is warranted for its practical application.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par28">We identified four limitations in this study. First, our results were derived by assessing the chondrocytes obtained from one patient only. Therefore, our data could not be simply generalized, and needs confirmation using chondrocytes from a variety of backgrounds including age and disease. Second, we could not clarify the effects of the duration of heat stimulus. There is a possibility that shorter or longer heat stimulation might have a positive effect on ECM synthesis. Third, we utilized the pellet culture system for mimicking the in vivo condition. We considered that this system was suitable for this study because it is simple and provides reproducibility as well as simulation of regenerative or developmental processes of articular cartilage. However, this system could not completely simulate the in vivo environment. We have reported that different culture systems such as monolayer and pellet culture systems show different responses to culture temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Similarly, chondrocytes in the pellet culture system might respond differently from chondrocytes in vivo. We focused on the effects of periodic heat stimuli during AC regeneration such as in ACI and utilized the pellet culture system to simplify but retain the 3-D culture condition in this study. Fourth, we did not measure the actual temperature within the pellets although we measured it in the culture medium. We consider that this does not affect our results because the synthesized pellets were small (minimum diameter of 1.4&#x02013;1.7&#x000a0;mm on day 21) and because the thermal conductivity of water is high. Therefore, we consider that the thermal conditions on and in the pellet would show a similar transition with the culture medium as described in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec20"><p>

To confirm the effects of higher heat stimulation, we performed an additional experiment applying heat stimulus between 41&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C to 45&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The pre-cultured pellets were subjected to heat stimulation at 41&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, 43&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, or 45&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 20 min in a water bath. A shows the temperature transitions in a conical tube immersed in a water bath set at the specific temperature. After the heat stimulus, the mRNA expression of COL2A1, ACAN, and HSPA1A was analyzed at 3, 6, and 24 hours after the stimulus (B, C, and D). The pellets cultured at 32&#x000b0;C were used as controls (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3 pellets/time point). The results showed that HSPA1A expression was apparently upregulated, indicating successful heat stimulus (B). However, the 41&#x000b0;C and 43&#x000b0;C groups showed no positive effects on COL2A1 and ACAN expression (C and D). Transient upregulation of COL2A1 and ACAN was observed at 6 hours after stimulation in the 45&#x000b0;C group (C and D), but these were downregulated at 24 h after the stimulus.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material>
