<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">A. CHALLENGES IN STUDYING SOCIAL ANIMALS<p><s>One of the main challenges of studying honeybee societies, and in fact most social animals, lies in the difficulty of emulating an appropriate social context where group-living animals can be investigated without overly disturbing their natural behavior.</s><s>Experiments in environments that differ significantly from their natural habitats might miss vital biotic and abiotic cues, like pheromones or light conditions, essential for influencing their group dynamics.</s><s>Additionally, using only a small number of animals, due to experimental apparatus constraints, can also bias results since individual behaviors often depend on interactions with nestmates <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, classes of animal behaviors can unfold over different temporal patterns, indicating the need for multitimescale studies <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">[15]</ref>, <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">[16]</ref>.</s><s>If specific behaviors require observations or interactions to be performed at short intervals, or over very long time spans, certain studies might be infea-sible in setups lacking the required sophistication.</s><s>Lastly, investigating complex behaviors might require a closed-loop interaction sequence, where the subsequent stimuli depend on an animal's response to preceding ones.</s><s>Achieving this dynamic interplay using traditional techniques, where states or parameters are manually adjusted, might be impractical <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">[17]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">B. ROBOTICS IN BEHAVIORAL BIOLOGY<p><s>The use of robots that interact with animals is a recent methodology for behavioral biology, or ethology, that attempts to overcome some of the above challenges <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Modern robotics, bolstered by advances in technology, can actuate quickly, can sense a wide range of variables, can track multiple parameters at high rates, can be programmed to execute sequences of actions at many levels of complexity, and tirelessly perform repetitive tasks.</s><s>Historically, ethological research has embraced pioneering techniques, setting the stage for contemporary interactive robotic studies in social animal research <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">[20]</ref>.</s><s>A notable early study by Nobel Prize laureate Nikolaas Tinbergen in 1950 employed a simple lure to investigate the feeding behavior of the herring gull <ref target="#b20" type="bibr">[21]</ref>, seeding the approach of presenting stimuli to animals with idealized mimics.</s><s>Fast forward a few decades, the use of robotics in behavioral studies, inspired by this approach, expanded.</s><s>For instance, Michelsen et al. utilized a mechanical honeybee mimic, which performed 15 Hz lateral oscillations in a repeating loop, in an attempt to decipher the intricacies of the waggle dance communication <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, Halloy et al. introduced autonomous robots into cockroach groups, and intriguingly, the insects perceived these robots as their kin <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref>, finding that the behavioral program of the robots, and inclusion of pheromones were key to enable the investigation.</s></p><p><s>While robotics in behavioral biology might seem nascent, a growing body of research showcases successful robotic integrations in experiments.</s><s>For example, a ''cyborg'' approach, where electrodes are inserted into the animal's nervous system, has been used to study insect locomotion, such as beetles <ref target="#b22" type="bibr">[23]</ref> and locusts <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">[24]</ref>, as well as robotic navigation using an animal's sensory apparatus such as antennae of moths <ref target="#b24" type="bibr">[25]</ref>.</s><s>An alternative approach, central to robotics investigating social interactions, is to present stimuli externally, that is, in a non-invasive manner.</s><s>Robotics have been developed to interact with a variety of species, including vertebrates such as ducks <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">[26]</ref>, chickens <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref>, frogs <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[28]</ref>, electric fish <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[29]</ref>, zebrafish <ref target="#b29" type="bibr">[30]</ref>, <ref target="#b30" type="bibr">[31]</ref>, and rummy-nose tetra fish <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[32]</ref>;

information exchange between different species <ref target="#b41" type="bibr">[42]</ref> to examine the possibility of coordinating collective decisions; honeybees' responses to thermal cues, in small groups of young worker bees <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[38]</ref>, <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[39]</ref>, and within intact colonies during the winter <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[40]</ref>; and the potential for aggregating small groups of bees with vibrational cues, generated by a distributed set of static robots <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[39]</ref>, <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">[43]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Generally, such robot-animal interaction relies on the robotic elements generating cues or signals that are perceived by the animals and consequently have a modulating effect on the animal behavior.</s><s>It is essential to identify an appropriate interaction pathway to ensure that the generated stimuli suit the specific organism and behavior being studied <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref>.</s><s>For example, to stimulate motion, two common approaches are the use of miniature mobile robots <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref>, <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[34]</ref>, <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">[35]</ref>, and gantry-style setups that move a lure in a constrained space <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">[22]</ref>, <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[33]</ref>, <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[41]</ref>, which may be hidden from view <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[36]</ref>.</s><s>Many different factors have been used in investigations by robots, including visual appearance <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">[32]</ref>, <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">[45]</ref>, <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">[46]</ref>, auditory signals <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">[27]</ref>, <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">[28]</ref>, substrate-born vibrations <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">[43]</ref>, odors <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref>, <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">[33]</ref>, <ref target="#b33" type="bibr">[34]</ref>, <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">[35]</ref>, <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">[36]</ref>, or thermal cues, as employed in studies with honeybees.</s></p><p><s>The studies mentioned have contributed to ethology using robotic systems.</s><s>However, it is important to note that the majority of these investigations have been conducted under laboratory conditions, involving small numbers of animals and over relatively limited timescales.</s><s>Robots have been deployed in natural habitats to observe animal behaviors on land <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">[47]</ref>, in water <ref target="#b47" type="bibr">[48]</ref>, and in the air <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">[49]</ref>, <ref target="#b49" type="bibr">[50]</ref>.</s><s>These studies were primarily focused on passive observation, aiming to minimize disturbances to animal behavior through techniques such as camouflage <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">[47]</ref> and biomimicry <ref target="#b47" type="bibr">[48]</ref>.</s><s>While this approach addresses the limitations of artificial environments and small group sizes, it does not attempt to generate any stimuli to interact with animals or deliberately induce specific behaviors.</s></p></div>

CONTRIBUTIONS<p><s>Despite the vast efforts to date, many gaps remain in the knowledge of thermoregulation in insects <ref target="#b58" type="bibr">[59]</ref>.</s><s>The integration of robotic systems into animal colonies may provide a new approach to studying collective thermoregulation: By using robotic systems aiming to generate stimuli that the animals perceive as signals from their own colony members, we could enable a more controlled, detailed observation of responses over long timescales.</s></p><p><s>In this work, we detail the design and validation of an interactive robotic system tailored to study the collective thermoregulatory behaviors of honeybee colonies from within their hives.</s><s>Drawing inspiration from recent methodologies <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref>, <ref target="#b59" type="bibr">[60]</ref>, we devised a stationary robotic system capable of mixing with complete honeybee colonies and compatible with scientific and agricultural hives (Fig. <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>After empirically characterizing the sensing and actuation functionalities of the system (Sec.</s><s>II), we performed two experiments with animal groups (Sec.</s><s>III).</s><s>The first experiment confirmed the system's capability to provide high-fidelity observations of thermoregulatory behaviors during warm and cold seasons.</s><s>The second experiment validated the thermal actuators' capabilities to modulate the collective position of thousands of bees.</s><s>The system was previously presented in the context of research on winter clusters <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[40]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, the current paper presents a technical perspective on the design choices and the development process, resulting in a biocompatible tool.</s><s>Here, we provide new experimental results that characterize the system performance and illustrate its functionality for investigating thermoregulation over extended periods of time.</s><s>The experiments with complete colonies demonstrate that the robotic system is a versatile tool applicable in multiple seasons such as investigating the broodnest in summer, and clustering in winter.</s><s>These results reveal the potential of the biohybrid robotic system in future studies to confirm or challenge existing understanding in collective thermobiology.</s></p><p><s>The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section II presents the specification and detailed design of the robotic system.</s><s>It also provides characterization data for the sensor and actuator subsystems.</s><s>Section III presents experimental results involving complete animal colonies.</s><s>Section IV discusses the system and results in a broader context.</s><s>Finally, Section V provides methodological details on animals and collecting and processing experimental data.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">II. THE DESIGN OF AN INTERACTIVE ROBOTIC SYSTEM TO EXPLORE HONEYBEE THERMOBIOLOGY<p><s>Collective behaviors within a bee colony predominantly occur inside the hive <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">[8]</ref>, making their systematic and non-disruptive study challenging.</s><s>In this section, we outline the design, construction, and characterization of a robotic device tailored to integrate into a honeybee colony and interact with their collective thermoregulatory behaviors.</s><s>We elaborate on the system's overall architecture, its sensing and modulatory functionalities, and the mechanical  <ref type="figure">b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>) The location of the main parts of the system in a 3D representation of the robotic frame.</s><s>The orange zone indicates a portion of the frame, inaccessible to bees, dedicated to hosting most electronic parts of the system (excluding the temperature sensors).</s><s>The purple zone is allocated as space for bee occupancy, such as for comb construction.</s><s>The shape of the system is discussed in Sec.</s><s>II-D.</s></p><p><s>construction ensuring compatibility with both agricultural and scientific hives.</s><s>Finally, we describe the adopted procedures to prepare the system for animal integration.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">A. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE<p><s>A device intended to form a mixed society with living animals must, like most robots, possess sensing and actuating capabilities complemented by some computational power <ref target="#b13" type="bibr">[14]</ref>, <ref target="#b60" type="bibr">[61]</ref>.</s><s>Our system embodies these three elements, as illustrated in Fig. <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">2a</ref>.</s><s>At its core a 32-bit microcontroller unit (MCU, STMicroelectronics STM32F405) orchestrates the system, gathering data from sensors, managing thermal actuators, and communicating with external controlling devices.</s></p><p><s>To sense its surrounding environment, the system is equipped with an array of 64 temperature sensors distributed across the surface accessible to bees, therefore enabling the system to capture a detailed thermal snapshot in close proximity to the animals.</s><s>Auxiliary data regarding hive dynamics and microclimate are obtained using a carbon dioxide sensor and a humidity sensor (Sec.</s><s>II-B).</s><s>Additionally, a power sensor measures the input voltage and current drawn by the system, ensuring effective monitoring of the device's performance.</s></p><p><s>To allow interaction with the animals, the system employs a set of 10 thermal actuators each capable of dissipating 15 W.</s><s>These actuators are controlled by dedicated digital control loops and driving electronics (Sec.</s><s>II-C).</s><s>Additionally, the system is equipped with data storage capabilities via an SD card and supports various communication protocols including USB, CAN, UART, and I 2 C.</s><s>This multi-protocol support ensures that the system can be interfaced with a range of devices such as personal computers, single-board computers, or other microcontrollers located external to the hives.</s></p><p><s>The USB peripheral serves as the primary method of communication.</s><s>Its utilization is straightforward, given that the chosen MCU includes the necessary software stack and the physical layer electronics required for establishing communication with compatible devices.</s><s>Moreover, the robustness of USB is a significant advantage since it employs differential transmission lines and shielded cables, which are highly effective against electrical noise.</s><s>Also, to guarantee the integrity of the data during transmission, each set of sensory data is accompanied by a checksum.</s><s>This allows for detection of any data corruption that might occur during transmission events.</s></p><p><s>To enhance the chances of biocompatibility with bee colonies and with existing hive configurations, the robotic system was designed in the form of a beekeeping frame (Sec.</s><s>II-D).</s><s>It consists of acrylic layers encasing a printed circuit board, which serves as the base for the honeycomb and houses all electronic components.</s><s>Since bees are very protective towards their nest <ref target="#b61" type="bibr">[62]</ref>, <ref target="#b62" type="bibr">[63]</ref>, bees and electronics were separated by creating two segregated zones, the ''bee arena'' where bees can reside and build their honeycombs, and the ''electronics bay'' where electronic parts are housed inside a protected zone, inaccessible to bees (Fig. <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">2b</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">1) LOW-LEVEL SOFTWARE<p><s>The software embedded in the MCU serves as the linchpin for every component of the robotic device.</s><s>To effectively manage the low-level software execution, we employed a real-time operating system (RTOS, ChibiOS v19.1), chosen for its deterministic behavior.</s><s>The RTOS's multithreaded scheduler facilitated the compartmentalization of code into three distinct threads: sensing, actuating, and a MicroPython interpreter.</s><s>Each thread was assured execution within a precise and adjustable time frame.</s><s>Our inclusion of an onboard MicroPython interpreter aimed to streamline system parameter adjustments in real-time, eliminating the need to shut down the system, compile, and upload new code after every modification.</s><s>Additionally, the adoption of a language with simple syntax expanded the system's usability, making it approachable even for individuals without a background in embedded software development.</s></p><p><s>To increase the reliability and stability of the system during prolonged operation, we implemented the following features.</s><s>Firstly, we enabled the MCU watchdog timer (IWDG) to reset the MCU upon overflow and prevent system lockups.</s><s>Each task within the firmware was required to report its execution status.</s><s>The system handler, upon confirming all executions, would clear the watchdog timer to prevent the microcontroller from resetting.</s><s>The duration of the IWDG is dictated by the time required to complete the sensing and actuating threads.</s><s>Secondly, using a combination of the Real-Time Clock (RTC) and hardware registers, to record the reason for resets, allows the system to log and report reset events to the user, further increasing the system's reliability (see also Sec.</s><s>II-C7).</s></p></div>

of up to 2.7 °C in the uniformity of the thermal field across the actuator surface, as discussed in Sec.</s><s>II-C.</s><s>Such variations are particularly critical in studies that require precise thermal uniformity, highlighting an area in need of improvement.</s><s>To address this, future modifications could include reducing the size of the actuators, altering the PCB design and its layer stack-up to minimize the number and size of copper structures (such as traces and planes) beneath each actuator, and introducing horizontal slots between the rows of top and bottom actuators to enhance thermal isolation.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, with the promising results of the robotic device thus far, we can envision integrating additional sensor modalities to broaden the system's observation capabilities.</s><s>For instance, sound sensors have been effectively used to identify the presence of the queen <ref target="#b108" type="bibr">[109]</ref> and to detect swarming behaviors in the colony <ref target="#b109" type="bibr">[110]</ref>.</s><s>Another intriguing further development could involve employing specialized gas sensors, which may facilitate the detection of

to merely environmental changes within the nest?</s><s>When actuators replay temperature time series recorded from winter clusters, are they more attractive to the bees in comparison to fixed setpoints (see <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">[29]</ref>)?</s><s>Here, it is worth noting that besides synthetic thermal patterns and replaying natural trajectories, our system could also over-express stimulus trajectories -akin to robotic models over-expressing morphological features <ref target="#b45" type="bibr">[46]</ref> or behavioral ones <ref target="#b111" type="bibr">[112]</ref>.</s><s>Experiments aiming to identify robot-mediated thermal profiles that stimulate a small colony to behave similarly to a larger non-stimulated colony may provide insights into these questions of 'social integration' of the robots <ref target="#b11" type="bibr">[12]</ref>.</s><s>How do varying internal and external environmental conditions impact the capacity of these thermal actuators to influence behaviors?</s><s>Using our robotic systems to modify hive-internal conditions, in conjunction with a thermally controlled chamber to stabilize <ref target="#b86" type="bibr">[87]</ref> or modify <ref target="#b112" type="bibr">[113]</ref> the ambient experienced by a colony would allow such investigation.</s></p><p><s>Looking ahead, our research aims to harness the platform's sensing capabilities during the foraging season, specifically to investigate the dynamics of the collective thermoregulation of the broodnest and investigate the potential of inferring population evolution (i.e., demographic forecasting).</s><s>Furthermore, we are curious to discern whether there are specific thermal cues that can influence the queen's oviposition location <ref target="#b113" type="bibr">[114]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In this work, we have described the investigative potential of a novel robotic system designed to interact with honeybee colonies,

AUXILIARY SYSTEMS<p><s>Diverse supportive devices and procedures were used alongside the robotic system and hives to gather auxiliary data, improve data quality, or store collected data.</s><s>In this study, imagery played a crucial role in exploring patterns within sensor data streams and understanding the structure and organization of honeybee groups that produced this data (for example <ref type="bibr">Figures 5,</ref><ref target="#b6" type="bibr">7,</ref><ref target="#b7" type="bibr">and 8)</ref>.</s><s>To avoid disrupting the natural darkness within the beehives, we used infrared light illumination, a frequency band invisible to bees <ref target="#b115" type="bibr">[116]</ref>.</s><s>Images were captured by Raspberry Pi High-Quality cameras equipped with a Sony IMX477 sensor featuring 12.3 megapixels and a 6-mm lens.</s><s>For each robotic frame installed in an observation hive, two cameras were used, one for each side of the frame.</s><s>The original acrylic windows of the observation hive were substituted with non-reflective glass to diminish the reflection from infrared illuminators.</s><s>Each camera was connected to a Raspberry Pi 4 Single-Board Computer (SBC) that managed the shooting interval and stored the images on its SD card.</s><s>During warmer periods, when the Field Lab experienced significant day-night thermal gradients, the wooden floor's slight expansion or contraction would marginally displace the cameras.</s><s>To counter this, we attached the observation hives and cameras to a single five-centimeter thick tabletop.</s></p><p><s>In all experiments presented here, robotic frames were controlled via a Raspberry Pi, which also functioned as a local data storage system, saving all robotic data into text files.</s><s>Although not essential, this data was periodically transmitted to an InfluxDB time-series database via the Field Lab's wireless network.</s><s>The database centralized all collected data and facilitated querying the data from multiple colonies <ref target="#b116" type="bibr">[117]</ref>.</s><s>InfluxDB's web interface enabled simple dashboard creation and remote data visualization.</s><s>For remote control of the robotic frames or database access, the Field Lab network was accessible through an encrypted SSH (Secure Shell) connection.</s></p><p><s>A weather station (Ecowitt Eurochron EFWS 2900, with temperature precision of 5% and resolution of 0.1 °C) was used to monitor internal and external atmospheric conditions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">C. DATA ANALYSIS 1) STATISTICS<p><s>Throughout the text, if not explicitly stated otherwise, metrics of central tendency and dispersion are calculated by the median value and the median absolute difference, MAD, for their robustness against outliers <ref target="#b117" type="bibr">[118]</ref>.</s><s>The values representing measurements' uncertainty depict the combined uncertainty u c of the systematic and statistical uncertainties of the experimental setup and the observed data set.</s><s>If not stated otherwise, the uncertainty values are written after the symbol ''±'' and are calculated by summing in quadrature the instrument(s) uncertainties and the sample set median absolute difference, MAD (u c = MAD 2  + u 2 inst ).</s><s>Whenever sensors malfunctioned their data was removed from the analyzed data set.</s><s>In the observation experiment (Sec.</s><s>III-A), two sensors malfunctioned (n. <ref type="bibr">31 and 46)</ref>.</s><s>During the modulation experiment (Sec.</s><s>III-B) one sensor (n.63) from the bottom robot also malfunctioned.</s><s>All data analysis was performed in Python version 3.11.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">2) RECREATING THERMAL FIELDS<p><s>In the default configuration, the system samples the sensor array every 10 s.</s><s>The sampling rate can be changed, by users or automated scripts, without interrupting the system.</s><s>Once the system acquires the temperature values (Fig. <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">3b</ref>), they are transmitted to a controller outside the hive (e.g., another microcontrolled device, a single-board computer, or a laptop) where data can be further processed and ingested into databases or recorded in files.</s><s>To reconstruct the thermal fields from the sensor array, we used a radial basis function method <ref target="#b118" type="bibr">[119]</ref> to interpolate temperature values in steps of 1 mm.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">3) IMAGE PROCESSING<p><s>To enhance the quality of the recorded images, a series of treatments were applied, including the correction of distortions introduced by the wide-view lens, adjustment of perspective, cropping to focus on regions of interest, and contrast enhancement through histogram equalization.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">D. ETHICS OF MIXING ROBOTS AND BEES<p><s>As we previously discussed in <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[40]</ref>, interactive robotic systems involve close interactions and information exchange with living animals <ref target="#b12" type="bibr">[13]</ref>, <ref target="#b119" type="bibr">[120]</ref>, prompting important ethical considerations.</s><s>In designing our non-invasive robotic systems and conducting experiments, we aimed to minimize potential adverse effects.</s><s>For instance, to reduce animal stress, any thermal stimuli emitted by the artificial agents were limited to levels that naturally occur within a bee colony.</s><s>Since our technology can only be used within managed hives, it will therefore only be in direct contact with honeybees both during and after the device's lifespan.</s><s>Consequently, its impact on the broader ecosystem is expected to be negligible.</s><s>However, the effects on the colony and species as a whole should be considered.</s><s>Our study used managed honeybee colonies.</s><s>Such bee colonies do not undergo evolutionary adaptation by natural selection.</s><s>In contrast, their evolution is predominantly shaped by artificial selection following bee-breeding principles <ref target="#b120" type="bibr">[121]</ref> for traits like low aggressiveness and high honey yield.</s><s>If robotics help a weak, perishing colony to thrive and reproduce, its feral offspring without such support would be subject to natural selection, i.e., without any further technological influence.</s><s>Therefore, we suggest that our robotic systems would have no long-term effects on the evolution of feral honeybees.</s></p><p><s>T obj = 30 °C (Fig. <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">S1</ref>).</s><s>An archive containing design files for hardware, firmware, and software of the system, is available on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10908593/</s></p></div><figure xml:id="fig_0" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">FIGURE 1 .<label>1</label><figdesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1.</s><s>A robotic system to interact with honeybee thermoregulatory behaviors.</s><s>(a) A beekeeper inspects a robotic frame installed in a hive.</s><s>(b) An important collective behavior, the winter cluster, forms when the colony experiences low temperatures.</s><s>(c) Horizontal thermal profile transecting the middle of the cluster, indicating ''safe'' temperatures near the center of the cluster and temperatures close to the ambient at the extremities of the frame.</s><s>(d) Close-up of a broodnest section, with larvae visible at the edge of the capped cells.</s><s>(e) In the foraging season, broodnest temperatures stay within 33 °C to 36 °C [18], [19].</s><s>The graph contrasts the tight regulation of a specific brood region (black dots) against ambient temperature fluctuations (blue curve).</s><s>Note: temperature graphs do not correspond to the photographed colonies.</s></p></div></figdesc><graphic coords="3,36.23,66.06,502.00,552.29" type="bitmap"></graphic></figure>
