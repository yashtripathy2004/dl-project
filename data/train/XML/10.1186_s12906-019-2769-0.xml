A drug-target-pathway network analysis connecting SXSM components with arrhythmia suggested that a prominent anti-arrhythmia mechanisms of SXSM was via &#x003b2;1-adrenergic signaling pathway, which was subsequently validated by immunofluorescence assay showing that SXSM indeed increased the expression of ADRB1 in cultured cardiomyocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">By combining approaches of clinical evidence mining, experimental model confirmation, network pharmacology analyses and molecular mechanistic validation, we show that SXSM is an effective treatment for bradycardia and it involves multiple component interacting via multiple pathways, among which is the critical &#x003b2;1-adrenergic receptor upregulation.

It was divided into sick sinus syndrome (SSS), escape rhythm, atrioventricular block (AV block) and intraventricular block [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This irregularity of heart rhythm may be either pathological or physiological. Extensive exercise causes a lower heart rate of 30&#x02013;60&#x02009;bpm in overall 50&#x02013;80% athletes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although congenital structural abnormalities always lead to conduction dysfunction, bradycardia may also occur in the normal heart as people growing up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Accumulating evidence has indicated that arrhythmia is one of the common complications in many brain or heart-disease patients now. Accompany with coronary artery disease, cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac infarction, and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Currently, bradycardia treatment consists of implanting Cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) and taking chemical drugs. Although pacemaker is clinically the most popular treatment, expensive operative cure is not suitable for all patients especially the old and the weak. In addition, device infection has become a major problem which results in another huge burden on the patients who paid an expensive implantation surgery costs already [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Recently, medicinal herbs have received considerable attention as treatment alternatives for arrhythmia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) have been used for centuries. Compared with western drugs, herbal medicine is more accessible, less expensive, and mostly with fewer side effects. Clinical reports suggested that Shenxian-Shengmai (SXSM) oral liquid, a CFDA-approved patent Chinese medicine, was effective in treating bradycardia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. SXSM formula consists of eight herbal components including Radix Ginseng Rubra (hongshen), Herba Epimedii Brevicornus (yinyanghuo), Fructus Psoraleae (buguzhi), Fructus Lycii (gouqizi), Herba Ephedrae Sinicae (mahuang), <italic>Asarum heterotropoides</italic> (xixin), Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae (danshen), and Hirudo (shuizhi). Prior studies revealed that therapeutic effect of SXSM on chronic arrhythmia was related to the elevation of Na<sup>+</sup>-Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase activity and increased expression of Cx43 and Kir2.1 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], increased expression of acetylcholinesterase, reduced level of nicotinic receptor and improved ATP supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, SXSM was recently reported to protect heart function in Ischemia/Reperfusion injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. To understand the chemical basis of SXSM&#x02019;s anti-arrhythmia activity, we previously identified a total of 64 compounds in SXSM by UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS and quantified 10 of the major constituents by UPLC-DAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, due to the lack of disease-targeted active component identification, the pharmacological mechanisms of SXSM remain to be elucidated.</p><p id="Par16">In this study, clinical evidence of SXSM was evaluated with a meta-analysis of all published reports up to date. Then, a chemical database of SXSM was constructed using data from a variety of TCM database resources and our validated experimental results. Network pharmacology analysis was preformed to identify potential drug-disease target relationship between SXSM components and bradycardia. The efficacy of SXSM in alleviating drug-induced arrhythmias was then confirmed in ex vivo cardiac model. The major network pharmacology-predicted mechanism of SXSM action was finally confirmed by immunofluorescent assay in cardiomyocytes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p id="Par17">Shenxian-Shengmai (SXSM) oral liquid was obtained from Shanxi Buchang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

All these clinical studies used same administration methods (oral), for the same time course (4&#x02009;weeks), and with same detection indexes of 24&#x02009;h Holter dynamic electrocardiogram. In addition, plasma viscosity, pacemaker parameters, or complications were reported in some of the articles. Among the fourteen selected articles, 14 cases of side effects such as mildly dry mouth, nausea, and fatigue, were documented with none of the adverse events reported extremely serious. The risk factor assessment of the article was based on Cochrane&#x02019;s seven assessment criteria, and the quality of the literature was examined on a random, double-blind basis. The results of each assessment are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> (More information available in supplemental materials). Overall, the Meta-analysis showed that the effective rate of the control group was 67.34%, while that of the SXSM treatment group was 88.14% by comparison, and total 95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.76, I<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0, Z&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.47 (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.00001, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Thus, it indicated that SXSM has a better clinical curative outcome in bradycardia patients. A heterogeneity analysis by funnel plot showed that all the literatures included were concentrated in the middle of the funnel and proved that there was no small sample effect in this study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b).

After mining literatures in PubMed and making supplement from online TCM databases, relevant targets were filtrated out to ensure each compound experimentally verified and database predicted with high-confidence. Please see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref> for protein interactions. Based on this targets database, we analyzed potential pathways affected by SXSM active components. PPI analysis and GO analysis in Cytoscape software were first used to show most probable drug-target interactions and related disease mechanisms. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, gene targets (in red) and enriched pathways and functions (large colored dots) for arrhythmia were ranked according to the topological coefficients of network analysis and predicted <italic>P</italic> Value (&#x02212;log). The top ten SXSM-targeted pathways associated with arrhythmia are in the order of: Oxytocin signaling, Platelet activation, GnRH signaling, Rap1 signaling, Adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, Calcium signaling, AMPK signaling, cAMP signaling, Estrogen signaling, and Thyroid hormone signaling. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3, possible interactions between SXSM components and bradycardia via specific pathways may include 14 SXSM components such as Epimedin B, Bavachalcone, and Ginsenoside Rb2 via Oxytocin signaling pathway; 17 components such as Ginsenoside Rb2, Salvianolic acid B, and Danshensu via platelet activation; 15 components such as Rosmarinic acid via GnRH signaling pathway; 12 components such as Ginsenoside Ro via Rap1 signaling pathway. Importantly, it was discovered that at least 19 SXSM components, such as Phenylpropanolamine, Pseudoephedrine, and Ephedrine, could play a role in regulating adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes. This prediction was further verified in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) database by specifically analyzing bradycardia-related targets. G-protein coupled receptors, ion channels, and enzymes are among the major disease target types revealed. In all, 17 arrhythmia-related targets were identified, consistent with the expectation that a multi-target interaction mechanism may be involved in a multi-component medicine such as SXSM. In particular, the family of adrenergic receptors occupied a significant proportion of disease-related targets (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) and was chosen for the validation test next.

Using network pharmacology analysis followed by experimental validation, we proved that mechanistically the anti-bradycardia effect of SXSM could be at least in part by upregulation of ADRB1 expression in cardiomyocytes. Innovations of this paper include: 1) an integrative study from clinical data meta-analysis to network pharmacology mechanism prediction and validation on a compound TCM formula; 2) discovery and confirmation that one of the possible anti-bradycardia mechanisms of SXSM is by regulating cardiac &#x003b2;1-adrenergic pathway.</p><p id="Par33">In this study, we started from the clinical case analysis and found that SXSM indeed showed advantages in the treatment of bradycardia. It is worth noticing that while this research paper was in submission, a review article was published that also evaluated the effectiveness of some common TCM formulas, including SXSM, in treating patients with bradycardia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The meta-analysis (including 1197 in SXSM group and 1133 in control group) was performed with a fixed- effect model as no significant heterogeneity was found (<italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;50%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.1). It showed that SXSM was effective in treating bradycardia (RR: 1.33, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.39, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.00001). Although the conclusions reached in this study and ours presented in this paper are consistent, our study design has eliminated the arrhythmia caused by other diseases during the screening process and chosen a fixed time course of 4&#x02009;weeks. It is widely accepted that clinical and methodological source contribute to the heterogeneity of statistics. For our analysis, firstly, the dosage and time of SXSM oral liquid used by the patients were consistent. There were differences in the severity of bradycardia of patients in the fourteen included trials. Secondly, for most of these studies, the sample sizes were small and none of the trails were double blinded. Thirdly, doctor&#x02019;s diagnose level and ECG equipment used in different hospitals could contribute additional variability. Therefore, high quality randomized clinical trials are needed to further clarify the SXSM efficacy as a complementary therapy for arrhythmia.</p><p id="Par34">We used an isolated rat heart model of drug-induced bradycardia to experimentally confirm the SXSM effect. As expected, administration of acetylcholine increased LF\HF value, slowed heart rate, demonstrated an enhanced vagus nerve and sympathetic nerve activity in the model group. After treatment of SXSM, both the LF\HF ratio and heart rate reversed to normal level. We speculated that this phenomenon was because of the chemical composition in SXSM regulate the release of autologous acetylcholine by affecting the nerve activity, thereby maintaining its level in the steady state and finally increasing the heart rate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par35">The complexity of the chemical composition in TCM formulas brings great challenges to pharmacological research. Network pharmacology of data mining and prediction has played a guiding role in the research of potential mechanism in recent years. It has become one of the most widely used techniques to explore compound TCM formulas. Our analysis showed that neuromodulation of SXSM is mainly via affecting the ADR receptor family (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Twenty-nine of these targets were common for both disease and drug chemical database, which were listed in Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S4. Compounds originated from Herba Ephedrae Sinicae (mahuang) and Herba Epimedii Brevicornus (yinyanghuo) contribute mostly to the influence of ADR receptor family, particularly ADRB1 protein, which is known to affect heart rhythm by neuronal regulation. The rest compounds from other six herbs tend to play a role in humoral regulation that is associated with cytokines in the process of inflammation and injury, such as TNF, TGF&#x003b2;1, IL6, and SIRT6. This indicated that SXSM could be considered to treat those patients who suffered from cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, myocardium inflammation and thrombus in order to prevent complication of bradycardia.</p><p id="Par36">Holistic approach is the core principle of Traditional Chinese medicine, which is also supported by our findings in this study. For example, the effect of SXSM on elevating heart rate in bradycardia not only include heart-specific actions such as &#x003b2;1-Adrenergic receptor activation1, but also multiple neuronal regulation in brain and systemic inflammatory response. However, a holistic action of a compound formula is composed of multiple compound-specific actions &#x02013; only when we understand these individual compound-specific action and integrate them into a coordinated network, that we will be fully interpret a holistic action. Our pathway prediction suggested a potential mechanism of multi-target regulation of arrhythmia by a TCM formula. The top10 predicted signaling pathways revealed significant functional implications. For example, oxytocin (OT) is a common neurotransmitter released by paraventricular nucleus (PVN). It is related to regulation of pain perception. The heart protective effects of OT are mediated through opening the mitoKATP channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Thrombosis is common in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and arrhythmia is tightly associated with myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction. Changes of platelet reactivity to thrombin observed after restoration of sinus rhythm in patients proved that arrhythmia intrinsically leads to increased reactivity of platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a neurotransmitter that reported to have connection with inflammation signaling in cardiomyocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Epac2-Rap1 signaling regulates reactive oxygen species production and susceptibility to arrhythmia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Analysis of Rap1 signaling pathway indicates that SXSM may affect cellular interaction and attenuate mitochondrial ROS production and reduce arrhythmia susceptibility. &#x003b2;-adrenergic regulation of late Na<sup>+</sup> current during cardiac action potential and its regulation of arrhythmia was recently reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Actually, calcium signaling and cAMP signaling pathways are partially overlapping and closely related to adrenergic signaling pathway. Abnormal calcium handling results in a predisposition to atrial fibrillation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Our prediction of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway suggests that SXSM may also play a role in affecting energy metabolism in cardiomyocytes. AMPK activation has attracted more and more attention in the development of new therapeutic strategies for cardiometabolic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In summary, we believe that from the SXSM components identified so far, its anti-bradycardia effect are mainly focused on regulating the release of neurotransmitters, causing nervous system excitement. Supplemented by promoting blood flow and increasing energy metabolism, finally increased the heart rate.</p><p id="Par37">The new guideline on the evaluation and management of patients with bradycardia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] demonstrated that for patients with acute bradycardia of AV block, who are at low likelihood of coronary ischemia but associated with symptoms or hemodynamic compromise, &#x003b2;-agonist drugs (such as isoproterenol, dopamine, dobutamine, or epinephrine) are recommended treatment to increase heart rate and improve symptoms. Cardiac &#x003b2;-adrenergic pathway is one of the classic pathways for regulating arrhythmias. &#x003b2;1-Adrenergic receptor (&#x003b2;1-ARs) activation can provoke arrhythmia mediated by activate cAMP-dependent Ca2<sup>+</sup> release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via phosphorylation of RyR2. In the updated classification of antiarrhythmic drugs published in 2018, &#x003b2;-receptor modulators are classed as type II antiantiarrhythmic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. What&#x02019;s more, cAMP can activate both protein kinase A (PKA) and the exchange protein directly triggered by cAMP (Epac) which mediates &#x003b2;1-AR-induced arrhythmia via CaMKII or RyR2 phosphorylation, and activates LTCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Some prior studies indicated that SXSM could regulate RYR2\PLB protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which may cause LTCC activation via L-calcium channel. &#x003b2;-adrenergic pathway has been a frequent focus for research of cardiac diseases like heart failure and hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Our network pharmacology prediction and experimental validation confirm that SXSM may play a therapeutic role through this classic pathway, providing guidance for its rational clinical application.</p><p id="Par38">It is worth noticing that over the recent years, adrenaline has been gradually recognized to also inhibit inward potassium current I<sub>ks</sub>, activate acetylcholine coupled inward potassium current I<sub>ache</sub>, regulate multiple ion channels, and coordinate antiarrhythmic drugs. Ion channels on cellular membranes play a direct and crucial role in the formation of normal heart rhythm, whose open and close process leads to the generation of action potential (AP). Once the dynamic equilibrium on ion channels is broken, arrhythmia may occur. Accordingly, most of the current anti-arrhythmic drugs are ion channel modulators. Electrophysiological research on compounds present in the eight Chinese herbs in SXSM has not been carried out extensively so far, which limited the power of our network pharmacology analysis. However, it also justifies that further investigation of SXSM should include electrophysiological exploration of its components on ion channel target.</p><p id="Par39">In summary, although traditional Chinese herbal medicine has a long history of the treatment for cardiac rhythm symptoms dating back to as early as in the Han dynasty of China, it has not received enough attention due to the lack of in-depth clinical to basic science investigations. Our future work will identify active chemical components and reveal their specific mechanisms of SXSM, hoping to provide alternative therapeutic options to arrhythmia patients who could not accept pacemaker implantation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par40">In this study, we established the efficacy of Shenxian-Shengmai Oral Liquid for bradycardia by both meta-analysis of clinical data and ex vivo study in rat heart.

Our approaches integrated clinical, experimental and network pharmacology analyses to reveal the compounds-targets-pathways-disease connections and uncover the underlying mechanisms of a compound herbal medicine, which could be applied to other multi-component traditional Chinese medicine investigation where ample clinical data are accumulated but advanced mechanistic studies are lacking.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec23"><p>
