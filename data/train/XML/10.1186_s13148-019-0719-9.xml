Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) were used to find the interacting gene with SEPT9. Immunostaining of CD206 in cervical cancer and polarization of macrophages (M2) were evaluated by immunofluorescence and WB.

According to the latest global data released by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there were 569,847 new cases of cervical cancer worldwide in 2018, and 311,365 deaths attributed to cervical cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although HPV vaccination and early screening programs have emerged as effective strategies in disease prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], the high incidence rates are observed in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. And even though there has been a marked increase in survival rate from cervical cancer in China, this increase was still lower than some developed countries such as Canada, Norway, and Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">At present, DNA methylation-based assays that can be used as a biomarker for the detection of advanced CIN2/3 lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and a lot of methylated genes have been described as promising markers for the management of HPV-positive women, such as SOX1, PAX1, JAM3, EPB41L3, CADM1, and MAL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It is significant to explore and develop more sensitive and specific DNA methylation assays in order to further improve the early detection of cervical cancer.</p><p id="Par22">According to the NCCN guidelines, the standard treatment of advanced cervical cancer is a combination of &#x003b3;-irradiation and cisplatin-based chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, when radiotherapy and chemotherapy are given concurrently, both acute and late toxicity become important concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. An epidemiologic and clinical analysis of cervical cancer from Japan showed poorer prognosis for younger age patients in the radiation-based treatment group despite a rise in relative survival rates shown by the recent statistics; hence, pointing towards the requirement of further improvement in therapeutic modalities for more advanced cases with distant metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although tumor size and FIGO stage may efficiently serve as markers for responsiveness to radiotherapy, the resistance of tumor cells to radiation remains a major therapeutic hurdle. Therefore, it is necessary to find new molecular targets to investigate the exact mechanism of cervical cancer and assess the radiation sensitivity.</p><p id="Par23">Septins constitute a family of GTP-binding proteins that are involved in a variety of biological processes such as cytoskeleton formation, cell division and tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Promoter hyper-methylation of SEPT9 has been confirmed as a potent biomarker in colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and some other cancers. SEPT9 has been identified as a potential oncogene, and its overexpression was observed in several carcinomas, including breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], ovarian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], head and neck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, the mechanism of SEPT9 in cervical cancer still remains largely unexplored.</p><p id="Par24">In the present study, we firstly found that hyper-methylation of SEPT9 exhibits a high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of cervical cancer. Up- and downregulation of SEPT9 affected the biological behavior of cervical cancer cells through the regulation of HMGB1. Moreover, we found that SEPT9 mediated miR-375 could enhance the cell resistance to ionizing radiation via affecting the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Tissue specimens</title><p id="Par25">A total of 80 cases of specimens, including paired cervical cancer tissues and para-carcinoma normal tissues, were collected from cervical cancer patients who underwent surgery in the Qilu Hospital of Shandong University from 2013 to 2017.

One of the most remarkable breakthroughs, a sensitive blood-based colorectal cancer (CRC) screening test, uses the SEPT9 biomarker and specifically detects a majority of CRCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In April 2016, the plasma-based SEPT9 methylation assay, developed as the Epi proColon test, became the first blood test approved by the FDA for CRC screening. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for cervical cancer every 5&#x02009;years with HPV testing in combination with cytological test in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In our study, the methylated SEPT9 test detected cervical cancer with 73.1% sensitivity and 78.7% specificity in tumor tissues. The efficiency and feasibility of the test conducted alone or in combination with conventional HPV DNA test and cytology in cervical cancer screening need to be further evaluated and verified.</p><p id="Par50">A well-known mechanism operating in cancer has shown that CpG islands (CGIs) hyper-methylation at promoter sites represses transcription of genes acting as tumor suppressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Some studies have found an apparently positive correlation between methylation of gene body CGIs and gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. As an instance, we can consider a study conducted on a clinically relevant hepatocellular carcinoma mouse model that was used to verify that the expression levels of certain oncogene sets, characterized by hypermethylated CGIs either in their 5&#x02032;-UTR or in the gene body, were found to be elevated in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Ball et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] had confirmed that gene-body methylation in highly expressed genes is a consistent phenomenon throughout the human genome. Aran et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] showed that positive correlation between gene-body hyper-methylation and gene expression is restricted to proliferative tissues and cell lines. Interestingly, our data showed that a clear positive correlation existed between SEPT9 DNA methylation and mRNA expression; however, the mechanism remains unclear. It has been reported that the knockdown of mammalian Septin family member, Septin 9 protein, isoform 1 (SEPT9_i1), a protein product of Septin 9 transcript variant 1(SEPT9_v1), affected cell proliferation, deregulated cell cycle, reduced angiogenesis, and decreased migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Our study systematically investigated the functions of SEPT9 in cervical cancer tumorgenesis both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we found SEPT9 exhibited significantly differential expression between cervical cancer and para-carcinoma tissues. We also illustrated that SEPT9 could promote proliferation, invasion, and migration of cervical cancer cells and regulate the cell cycle.</p><p id="Par51">Radiotherapy had been regarded as one of the most commonly used treatments for several cancers; however, several associated toxicities and evolution of insensitivity to radiotherapy have posed a big problem. In a study, BCL2 over-expressers showed significantly better response to salvage radiotherapy compared to low-expressers in prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Another study shows that NanoOlaparib could enhance the radio-sensitivity of radiation-resistant tumors lacking BRCA mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Radiotherapy is the most effective therapy for advanced stages of cervical cancer. It is equally effective in treating early tumors as radical surgery, and it reduces local recurrences after surgery for patients with high-risk features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, some cervical cancers develop resistance to radiotherapy, which can significantly compromise the clinical outcome. A study indicated ICAM-3 overexpression is associated with radiation resistance in cervical cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The signaling from p-AKT could lead to radiation resistance in locally advanced cervical cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Unfortunately, there is no available treatment specific to cervical cancer patients with radio-resistance. From this perspective, we investigate the relationship between SEPT9 and the radio-sensitivity in cervical cancer cells. We showed that the suppression of SEPT9 expression was partially responsible for the development of radio-sensitivity and that the ectopic expression of SEPT9 could be a potential strategy to develop radio-resistance in cervical cancer.</p><p id="Par52">To examine the mechanism by which SEPT9 regulates radio-sensitivity in cervical cancer cells, we explored the association between SEPT9 and HMGB1, and were pleasantly surprised to find that SEPT9 was negatively correlated to HMGB1 in cervical cancer cell lines. HMGB1 is a member of the HMGB protein family, which has several biological functions inside as well as outside the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Inside the cell, HMGB1 is an architectural chromatin-binding factor that binds DNA and promotes protein assembly on specific DNA targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Outside the cell, HMGB1 is a prototypical damage-associated molecular pattern, acting with cytokine, chemokine, and growth factor. In our study, a negative correlation between HMGB1 and SEPT9 expression was identified in cervical cancer by immunohistochemical staining. We not only established a direct interaction between SEPT9 and HMGB1 protein, but also confirmed the interaction between HMGB1 and RB, as it has been reported that intracellular HMGB1 functions as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer by directly binding to RB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Interplay between HMGB1 and RB regulates Topoisomerase II alpha expression and subsequently, genomic stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">It is well known that numerous macrophages are present in tumor tissues, termed tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), directly affecting tumor progression in many cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. TAMs can be designed as two functional types: M1 classically activated macrophages and M2 alternatively activated macrophages. Proinflammatory M1 macrophages are activated by IFN-&#x003b3; and LPS, expressing INOS. M2 macrophages release immunosuppressive cytokines, expressing CD206 and Arg1, and secrete IL-10 and IL-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. TAMs could contribute to tumor radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Meng [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] has reported that depletion of TAMs by systemic or local injection of the macrophage-depleting liposomal clodronate before radiotherapy can increase the antitumor effects of ionizing radiation. Several studies have been demonstrated that miRNAs, mRNA, protein, long non-coding RNA, within exosomes, apoptotic bodies, or lipoprotein bound could induce the polarization of TAMs. A recent study showed miR-375, bound to low-density lipoproteins (LDL), transfer from apoptotic breast cancer cells to TAMs via the CD36 receptor to enhance macrophage migration and infiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In our study, we also found that miR-375 could transfer from cervical cancer cell to TAMs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). We speculated that this transferation was through the same approach as in breast cancer cell line.</p><p id="Par54">In summary, our study suggested that SEPT9 methylation has the potential to become an effective screening factor for cervical cancer prior to diagnosis. SEPT9 promotes tumorigenesis, cell migration, and invasion and regulates the sensitivity of radiotherapy by targeting HMGB1-RB pathway and regulating the polarization of macrophages via miR-375 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Our study provided a possible screening indicator and radiotherapy sensitization target for cervical cancer.
