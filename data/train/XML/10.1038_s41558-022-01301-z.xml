<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Time of Emergence of Mean SST and Rainfall Change Signals<p><s>We begin by investigating the ToE of annual-mean SST based on 23 CMIP6 models under historical forcing before 2014 and various shared socio-economic pathway (SSP) emission scenarios thereafter.</s><s>This requires estimates of both signal and noise of annual-mean SST (see "Signal, noise, and ToE of annual-mean SST and rainfall" in Methods).</s><s>A map of the multi-model ensemble mean (MEM) regression coefficients, representing the response of annual-mean SST to global warming, displays a basin-wide warming in the tropical Pacific together with more warming in the EEP <ref target="#b34" type="bibr">35</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>, shaded), consistent with previous studies based on CMIP3 (ref. <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">36</ref></s><s>) and CMIP5 (ref. <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">5</ref></s><s>) models.</s><s>The spatial pattern of the noise exhibits largest values in the EEP region due to ENSO variability <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>, Contours).</s><s>The spatial pattern of the ToE of annualmean SST indicates that the climate change signal should already be detectable across almost the whole tropical Pacific, with the signal emerging last in the EEP where the noise is the largest (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>The distribution of the ToE and the noise have a similar pattern, with the spatial correlation of up to 0.8 in the MEM (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>) and being statistically significant in all individual models (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), indicating a dominant role of the noise in shaping the spatial distribution of the ToE of annual-mean SST in models.</s></p><p><s>On the other hand, the MEM annual-mean rainfall response to global warming displays a robust increase along the central to eastern equatorial Pacific with a high inter-model consensus, which is linked to the consistent eastward migration of the Pacific Walker circulation <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">10</ref> , and there is less inter-model consistency on the flanks of the climatological Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>, shaded), in agreement with previous studies <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">9,</ref><ref target="#b36" type="bibr">37</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The MEM noise of annual-mean rainfall exhibits a pattern with large values in the central equatorial Pacific, ITCZ and SPCZ regions, and relatively small values in the EEP (Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>, contours).</s><s>The estimated MEM ToE in most models under the SSP585 scenario, indicates that the annual-mean rainfall signal can be expected to emerge within the coming decades in the EEP, although no emergent signal appears in the ITCZ and the SPCZ by the end of the 21 st century (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We then focus on the EEP region where both detectable signals of annual-mean SST and rainfall emerge in the 21 st century in most models (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>As shown in Given that the background noise between MEM results and observations are comparable in magnitude (Fig. <ref type="figure">2c</ref>), the model-observation discrepancy in the ToE of EEP annual-mean SST change is attributable to different signals (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>).</s><s>Differences in signals of annual-mean SST can be further traced back to different responses of local annual-mean SST to global warming (bottom row in Fig. <ref type="figure">2d</ref>), as the model-observation discrepancy in the global-mean SST change is negligible (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">1b-c</ref>).</s><s>The responses of observed annual-mean SST, though with a similar basin-wide warming, display a pattern with an enhanced west-minus-east SST gradient featuring an EEP minimum warming (Extended Data Fig. <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">2a-c</ref>), in contrast to the local maximum warming in the MEM with a small inter-model difference (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref> and bottom row in Fig. <ref type="figure">2d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To highlight the spatial variation of SST response to global warming, we further decompose the annual-mean SST into two components: the tropical-mean SST ( tm T )</s></p><p><s>and the relative SST ( r T ) that is the deviation from the tropical-mean <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4</ref> .</s><s>By doing so, we find the model-observation discrepancy in the EEP annual-mean SST response to global warming is caused by the difference in the response of local r T , rather than that of tm T (top and middle rows in Fig. <ref type="figure">2d</ref>).</s><s>In the MEM, as well as individual models, the r T</s></p><p><s>shows a robust warming response in the EEP, whereas in observations there is consistent cooling response, albeit with different magnitudes (Fig. <ref type="figure">2d</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">2d-g</ref>).</s></p><p><s>An inter-model relationship reveals that the ToE of the EEP annual-mean SST is highly correlated to the earlier ToE (earlier than 2000 in all but one of the models) of the tm T (r=0.88,</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">2e</ref>), but not to the much later ToE (later than 2050 in all models) of the EEP r T (Fig. <ref type="figure">2f</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the modelled emergent signals of the EEP annual-mean SST mainly reflect signals of the tm T .</s><s>The earlier ToE of the tm T is a result of both a stronger response of the tm T (Fig. <ref type="figure">2d</ref>) and weaker background noise (Supplementary Fig. <ref target="#fig_8" type="figure">3a</ref>), while the later ToE of the r T is caused by both a weaker response of the r T (Fig. <ref type="figure">2d</ref>) and stronger background noise (Supplementary Fig. <ref target="#fig_8" type="figure">3b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Given comparable ToE of tm T (Fig. <ref type="figure">2e</ref>) and noise of r T (Supplementary Fig. <ref target="#fig_8" type="figure">3b</ref>) between the MEM results and observations, the model-observation discrepancy in the ToE of annual-mean SST is thus mainly due to the widely-discussed difference between a warming response of r T in the EEP, featuring a weakened west-minus-east SST gradient in models and an opposite response in observations.</s><s>Although the cause for such opposing responses is still a matter of debate <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">[38]</ref><ref target="#b38" type="bibr">[39]</ref><ref target="#b39" type="bibr">[40]</ref><ref target="#b40" type="bibr">[41]</ref><ref target="#b41" type="bibr">[42]</ref> , we find that both the modelled and observed responses of EEP r T are dependent on the length of the time period over which the responses are computed.</s><s>Regardless of whether the modelled EEP r T response is warming or cooling in the relatively short historical simulations, it can be warming in future projections when the time period is extended to the end of 21 st century (Extended Data Fig. <ref target="#fig_8" type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that a pattern with an EEP warming response of r T featuring a weakened west-minus-east SST gradient will emerge in the future as GHGs forcing continues.</s></p><p><s>For rainfall in the EEP, we focus on the model outputs, as observational records are reliable only during the satellite era, thus are too short to capture the long-term global warming-induced signal <ref target="#b42" type="bibr">43</ref> .</s><s>The estimated MEM ToE under different emission scenarios shows that detectable signals of annual-mean rainfall can be found around mid-century under the SSP245, SSP370 and SSP585 scenarios (in years 2070, 2054 and 2043, respectively), but not under the SSP126 scenario which features the lowest GHGs forcing (Fig. <ref target="#fig_8" type="figure">3a</ref>).</s><s>For individual models under the most aggressive SSP585 scenario, all models but two show detectable signals of annual-mean rainfall by the end of 21 st century, while all models but two do not show detectable signals before 2020 (Fig. <ref target="#fig_8" type="figure">3b</ref>), suggesting a robust inter-model consensus of the undetectability of an annual-mean rainfall signal by now.</s><s>The inter-model difference in the ToE of annual-mean rainfall, with signals emerging as early as before 2020 in a few models (such as CanESM5) and as late as after 2080 in other models (such as MPI-ESM1-2-LR), is larger than that of annual-mean SST.</s><s>Nevertheless, the estimated ToE of EEP annualmean rainfall is later than that of annual-mean SST in all models by several decades (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b,</ref><ref target="#fig_8" type="figure">3b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To investigate the cause of a later ToE of annual-mean rainfall, we decompose rainfall change into a thermodynamic component ( q     ) due to moisture change, and a dynamic component ( q    ) due to circulation change based on a simplified moisture budget analysis <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">37</ref> .</s><s>The result indicates that the weak response of annual-mean rainfall in the ITCZ and SPCZ is caused by an offsetting effect between a positive response of the thermodynamic component and a negative response of the dynamic component, while the robust positive response of EEP annual-mean rainfall is almost entirely due to the dynamic component-an equatorial and eastward shift in rainfall (Supplementary Fig. <ref target="#fig_9" type="figure">4</ref>), in agreement with previous studies <ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24,</ref><ref target="#b24" type="bibr">25</ref> .</s><s>As such, the ToE of EEP annual-mean rainfall appears to not be influenced by the thermodynamic component (Fig. <ref target="#fig_8" type="figure">3c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s><s>Rather, it is almost totally determined by the ToE of dynamic component, with the inter-model correlation coefficient between the two being up to 0.97 (Fig. <ref target="#fig_8" type="figure">3e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The response of the EEP q    is controlled by an ascending circulation response, which is driven by a local positive warming response of r T (Supplementary Fig. <ref target="#fig_9" type="figure">4b</ref>, contours), suggestive of the "warmer gets wetter" paradigm <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">4,</ref><ref target="#b36" type="bibr">37</ref> .</s><s>The significant inter-model relationship between the response of q    and r T and the insignificant relationship with tm T in the EEP (Extended Data Fig. <ref target="#fig_9" type="figure">4</ref>) further confirms that it is the r T , rather than the tm T , that plays an important role in the response of EEP q    .</s><s>This contributes to a later ToE of annual-mean rainfall compared with that of the annual-mean SST, which mainly reflects the early ToE of the tropical-mean SST (Fig. <ref type="figure">2e</ref>).</s><s>Likewise, we would expect the signal of observed annual-mean rainfall to emerge later than the signal of observed annual-mean SST.</s></p></div>

response and the structural response.</s><s>The former depicts the intensity change by assuming that the spatial pattern under global warming is fixed, while the latter indicates shifts in spatial pattern (see "Separation of amplitude and structural changes in ENSO SST and rainfall" in Methods).</s><s>For ENSO SST, the increased amplitude response plays a greater role than the response of structural change (Supplementary Fig. <ref target="#fig_10" type="figure">5a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, for ENSO rainfall, the eastward-shifted structural response plays a more important role in the ENSO rainfall response compared with the increased amplitude response (Supplementary Fig. <ref target="#fig_10" type="figure">5c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>A comparison between the ToE of ENSO SST and rainfall change signals in the EEP reveals that the modelled ToE of ENSO rainfall signal is generally earlier than that of ENSO SST signal by several decades (Fig. <ref target="#fig_10" type="figure">5a-d</ref>), which is opposite to the ToE behavior of the annual-mean SST and rainfall change signals.</s><s>In the MEM, the ENSO SST signal is expected to emerge under both the SSP585 and SSP370 scenarios in the 30-year time windows ending at 2070 and 2073, respectively, but not under the other two lower scenarios (SSP126 and SSP245) (Fig. <ref target="#fig_10" type="figure">5a</ref>), indicative of some sensitivity to emission scenarios.</s><s>The ToE of ENSO rainfall, however, is projected to be in this century under all the SSP126, SSP245, SSP370 and SSP585 scenarios in the 30-year time windows ending at 2039, 2045, 2042 and 2037, respectively, separated by less than a decade (Fig. <ref target="#fig_10" type="figure">5b</ref>).</s><s>Under SSP585 and SSP370 scenarios, ToE of ENSO rainfall is ~ 30 years earlier than that of ENSO SST.</s></p><p><s>As exemplified by the results projected under the SSP585 scenario, the estimated ToE of ENSO rainfall is also earlier than that of ENSO SST in most individual models (Fig. <ref target="#fig_10" type="figure">5c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>For ENSO SST, 17 out of 23 (around 74%) models show a ToE before the end of the 21 st century (Fig. <ref target="#fig_10" type="figure">5c</ref>), while for ENSO rainfall, all but one model (INM-CM5-0) shows the signal emerging (Fig. <ref target="#fig_10" type="figure">5d</ref>).</s><s>A large intermodel spread exists in the ToE of both ENSO SST and rainfall, with the inter-model standard deviation up to 50 years (Fig. <ref target="#fig_10" type="figure">5c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>), which, however, does not change our result of an earlier ToE of ENSO rainfall than ENSO SST.</s><s>Thus, the signal of ENSOrelated variability change, when measured by rainfall <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">6,</ref><ref target="#b23" type="bibr">24</ref> , is stronger and will emerge earlier as compared to that measured by SST.</s></p><p><s>To explore the cause of an earlier ToE of ENSO rainfall, we decompose ENSO rainfall change into a thermodynamic component ( c q     ) due to climatological moisture change, and a dynamic component ( c q    ) due to ENSO-driven atmospheric circulation change <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">15</ref> (see "Decomposition of 30-year climatological SST and ENSO rainfall change" in Methods).</s><s>The responses of both thermodynamic and dynamic components contribute to the increase in ENSO rainfall in the EEP, with the latter playing the major role (supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the ToE of ENSO rainfall appears to be dominated by the ToE of dynamic component (Fig. <ref target="#fig_10" type="figure">5e</ref>), while the much earlier ToE of thermodynamic component (Fig. <ref target="#fig_10" type="figure">5f</ref>), though playing a minor role, hastens the ToE of ENSO rainfall (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref>).</s><s>The ToE of dynamic component of ENSO rainfall, on the other hand, is controlled by that of the climatological relative SST change, with an inter-model correlation coefficient between the two reaching up to 0.69 (Fig. <ref target="#fig_10" type="figure">5g</ref>), indicating a "warmer gets wetter" paradigm on interannual timescale <ref target="#b47" type="bibr">48,</ref><ref target="#b48" type="bibr">49</ref> .</s><s>As the ToE of climatological relative SST change is earlier than that of ENSO SST (Fig. <ref target="#fig_10" type="figure">5a</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref>), the ToE of ENSO rainfall is also earlier.</s><s>In addition, the insensitivity of the ToE of ENSO rainfall to emission scenarios is attributable to the climatological relative SST change, which is also insensitive to emission scenarios (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Implications for Emergence of Rainfall Signals<p><s>Our estimations for ToE of annual-mean rainfall in the EEP based on MEM reveal that they are dependent on the future emission scenarios, with signals emerging as early as before 2050 under the SSP585 scenario; by contrast, annual-mean rainfall is undetectable by the end of this century under the lowest SSP126 scenario (Fig. <ref target="#fig_8" type="figure">3a</ref>).</s><s>This implies that climate mitigation could be effective in preventing significant rainfall shifts in the mean state.</s><s>However, the estimated MEM ToE of ENSO rainfall are only a few years apart in the different emission scenarios (Fig. <ref target="#fig_10" type="figure">5b</ref>).</s><s>Hence, we would expect to detect a significant signal of ENSO rainfall change before 2050 even if we follow a strong mitigation pathway such as the SSP126 or SSP245 scenarios.</s><s>Considering that ENSO rainfall is the main driver of global ENSO teleconnections, via heating of the atmosphere and the propagation of atmospheric waves to both the tropics and extratropics <ref target="#b49" type="bibr">50</ref> , the emergent ENSO rainfall change signal could trigger wide-ranging impacts on natural and human systems.</s></p></div>
