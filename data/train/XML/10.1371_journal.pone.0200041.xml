While there is much known about neonicotinoid toxicity effects at the colony stage of the bumblebee annual cycle, far less is known about such effects at other stages critical for the maintenance of wild populations. In the present work, individual-based feeding assays were used to show that chronic consumption of the widely used neonicotinoid clothianidin at a field-realistic average rate of 3.6 and 4.0 ng/g&#x000b7;bee/day reduces survival of queen and male bumblebees, respectively, within a 7-day period. In contrast, worker survival was unaffected at a similar consumption rate of 3.9 ng/g&#x000b7;bee/day. To test the hypothesis that males have a lower tolerance for oral clothianidin exposure than workers due to their haploid genetic status, RNAseq analysis was used to compare the transcriptomic responses of workers and males to chronic intake of clothianidin at a sub-lethal dose of 0.37ng/bee/day for 5 days. Surprisingly, clothianidin consumption only altered the expression of 19 putative detoxification genes in a sex-specific manner, with 11/19 genes showing increased expression in workers. Sub-lethal clothianidin exposure also altered the expression of 40 genes associated with other major biological functions, including locomotion, reproduction, and immunity. Collectively, these results suggest that chronic oral toxicity effects of neonicotinoids are greatest during mating and nest establishment phases of the bumblebee life cycle. Chronic oral toxicity testing on males and queens is therefore required in order to fully assess the impact of neonicotinoids on wild bumblebee populations.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#1501737</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9886-1324</contrib-id><name><surname>Gegear</surname><given-names>Robert J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the National Science Foundation (grant #1501737).

In North America alone, nearly half of the bumblebee species have reached historically low numbers [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], including one species, <italic>Bombus affinis</italic>, which was recently listed as an endangered species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. From an ecological perspective, these declines pose a significant threat to the function and diversity of temperate ecosystems due to the critical keystone role that bumblebees play as pollinators of native flowering plants. Reports of parallel reductions in bee-pollinated plant species suggest that pollinator decline-mediated effects on wildlife diversity at higher trophic levels may already be well underway [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200041.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200041.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It is therefore imperative that all anthropogenic stressors contributing to species decline in bumblebees be identified and mitigated as soon as possible.</p><p>One stressor thought to contribute to wild bumblebee decline in urban and agricultural areas is a newly developed class of pesticides called &#x02018;neonicotinoids&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. From a pest management perspective, neonicotinoids are a highly effective form of insect control because they specifically target nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the insect central nervous system, leading to paralysis and death [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, unlike most other pesticide classes, neonicotinoids are also systemic, meaning that they are readily taken up by the roots and distributed throughout the entire plant, thereby protecting it from pest damage over the entire growing season [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Despite these benefits, neonicotinoids pose a significant threat to beneficial insects such as pollinators because they are translocated to floral nectar and pollen, presenting a route of oral exposure. Of particular concern to wild pollinator populations is the fact that neonicotinoids can be transported away from the area of application to adjacent natural areas [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200041.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and then contaminate wildflower resources [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200041.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200041.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For example, clothianidin, one of the newest and most potent neonicotinoid formulations, has been detected in numerous animal-pollinated wildflower species at concentrations ranging from 4 to 215 ppb [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200041.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Compounding this issue, neonicotinoid residues can persist in the soil for years after a single application [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and increase in concentration with repeated annual application [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Wild bumblebees and other insect pollinators therefore have the potential to be orally exposed to neonicotinoids at life stages occurring outside of the blooming period and geographic location of the targeted plant species.</p><p>Yet, the overwhelming majority of neonicotinoid toxicity studies on bumblebees to date have focused only on the colony stage, relying on metrics such as worker survival, larval growth, and reproductive output to estimate the potential impact of exposure on wild populations [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. While such colony-focused risk assessment protocols may be adequate in the context of crop pollination, determining the impact of widespread neonicotinoid use on threatened bumblebee species in an ecological context requires more comprehensive assessment protocols that consider potential impacts on queens and males, whose survival during mating, overwintering, and nest establishment stages of the life cycle has a direct effect on population stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200041.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0200041.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0200041.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Annual cycle of social bumblebees.</title><p>The cycle begins when mated queens emerge from their overwintering sites in early spring and search for suitable nest sites. Once a suitable nest site has been found, the queen collects and stores floral resources (nectar and pollen) to raise the first brood of workers, which emerges in late spring. A subset of the workers emerging become &#x02018;foragers&#x02019; and leave the nest to collect floral resources for the queen and the rest of the workers in the colony. The number of workers (foragers and nest bees) in the colony continues to grow over the summer months. From late summer into the fall, the colony starts to produce new queens and males (reproductives) instead of workers. Reproductives leave the nest soon after emergence and search for a suitable mate until late fall. Once mated, queens search for an overwintering site and once located, reside there until the spring. Males and colonies (founding queen and workers) do not survive the winter, thus completing the cycle.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0200041.g001"/></fig><p>Several morphological and physiological characteristics of queen, worker, and male bumblebees suggest that individuals from each group may vary in their capacity to cope with chronic oral neonicotinoid exposure. For example, males and workers have a smaller body size than queens and therefore may experience mortality effects at lower neonicotinoid concentrations, as has been shown at the species level [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Males are also haploid whereas queens and workers are diploid, which may limit gene products available for males to detoxify neonicotinoids. Such &#x02018;haploid susceptibility&#x02019; is known to occur in the context of immunocompetence [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but has yet to be studied in the context of metabolic resistance to pesticides. Alternatively, males and queens have greater energetic demands due to their reproductive status [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200041.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and therefore may have fewer resources available for detoxification processes than sterile workers.</p><p>To explore these possibilities, the present study uses a novel individual-based feeding assay to directly compare the mortality response of queen, worker, and male <italic>Bombus impatiens</italic> to chronic consumption of the widely used neonicotinoid clothianidin at field-realistic concentrations of 5-10ppb. Assaying bumblebee test populations at the individual level provides a much more robust estimate of chronic lethality level than more traditional assays on small groups (e.g. microcolonies) because drug intake rates can be directly monitored in all test individuals and then easily standardized by adjusting for individual variation in body size and daily intake [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>The results of our initial feeding experiments revealed that chronic lethality effects of clothianidin are much greater in males than workers even when controlling for differences in body size. To test the potential role of male haploidy in driving this sex-specific response to clothianidin exposure, we then used RNAseq analysis to compare the transcriptomic responses of workers and males to consumption of clothianidin at a sub-lethal daily dose over a 5-day period. Following previous work on bumblebees by [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], putative genes related to clothianidin detoxification were identified and classified based on the two well-characterized xenobiotic detoxification phases in insects, with Phase 1 processes metabolizing the xenobiotic to less toxic compounds through oxidation, hydrolysis, and reduction reactions, and Phase 2 processes breaking down the metabolites produced from Phase 1 processes through conjugation reactions. Based on the findings of [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] that another bumblebee species (<italic>B</italic>. <italic>huntii</italic>) has fewer constitutively expressed detoxification genes than workers, it was predicted that male <italic>Bombus impatiens</italic> would have fewer and/or lower expression of inducible detoxification genes compared to workers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Experimental design</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Bumble bees</title><p>Virgin queens, workers, and males were obtained from commercial <italic>Bombus impatiens</italic> colonies (Biobest Biological Systems, Leamington, Canada).

Individuals not consuming all of the sugar solution within a 24 hour period were removed.</p><p>After the 48-hour acclimation period, individuals were assigned to either the 0 ppb (control), 5 ppb, 7ppb, or 10ppb treatment group, with colony origin and bee size balanced among groups. Location of housing containers within and between shelves inside the environmental chamber was randomized in order to control for potential positional effects on survival. Total number of bees tested at each clothianidin concentration was as follows: 208 at 0ppb (88 workers, 58 queens, 62 males), 178 at 5ppb (70 workers, 58 queens, 50 males), 178 at 7 ppb (70 workers, 58 queens, 50 males), and 264 at 10 ppb (108 workers, 84 queens, 72 males). These numbers were obtained through 11 independent worker, 8 queen, and 12 male trials, with bees in each trial obtained from at least two colonies. Given queens required a greater volume of test solution than workers and males (200 &#x003bc;L vs 75 &#x003bc;L, respectively) to remain active than workers and males due to their larger body size, we standardized exposure level for each group by expressing it as ng clothianidin consumed per gram of bee per day (ng/g&#x000b7;bee/day). Daily intake for queens = 2 ng/bee (10ppb), 1.4 ng/bee (7ppb), 1 ng/bee (5ppb); workers and males = 0.75 ng/bee (10ppb), 0.525 ng/bee (7ppb), and 0.375 ng/bee (5ppb).

In this way, we could directly test for sex and caste differences in clothianidin sensitivity.</p><p>Each day over a 7-day testing period, individual housing containers were removed from the environmental chamber within three hours after to the beginning of the light cycle, and the number of dead bees was recorded. In the rare case that a test individual was not dead but showed inverted orientation, extremity spasms, and unresponsiveness, it was recorded as dead and euthanized.

This clothianidin dose was selected because it did not reduce worker and male survival in our feeding experiments. This approach allowed us to isolate changes in gene expression induced by clothianidin consumption from changes induced by the consumption of DMSO, which is a xenobiotic and therefore has the potential to induce expression of genes involved in detoxification processes.</p><sec id="sec009"><title>Treatment and sample preparation</title><p>Individuals were euthanized at -20&#x002da;C 24 hours after the last dose (day 6), immediately dissected on ice by removing legs, wings, and proboscis, and transferred to -80&#x002da;C until ready for extraction.

Different adaptors were used for multiplexing samples in one lane. Sequencing was performed on Illumina Hiseq3000/4000 for a pair end 150 run.

GSA identifies the best statistical model among many that is the best for a specific gene, and then uses it to calculate p-value and fold change. All genes induced by clothianidin consumption were first isolated separately for each sex by comparing gene expression levels Test and Vehicle Control groups separately. In this initial screening process, a gene was considered to be differentially expressed if it had both a p-value (uncorrected) less than 0.05 and a fold change greater than 1.5. All differentially expressed genes in workers and males were then pooled to create a list of clothianidin-sensitive candidate genes.</p><p>To test for sex differences in the number and expression of detoxification genes induced by oral exposure to clothianidin, GSA analysis in Partek Flow was then used to compare normalized read counts for each clothianidin-sensitive candidate gene between workers and males in the Test group. A similar comparison of workers and males from the Vehicle Control group was not performed because there was no oral exposure to clothianidin. For this comparison, a false-discovery rate (FDR) approach was used to correct for multiple testing [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Genes with FDR step up values (corrected p-values) less than 0.1 were deemed to be significantly different.

We also found 12 genes whose function we could not identify based on current databases.

Controlling for body size, queens and males consuming clothianidin at an average intake rate of 3.6 and 4.0 ng clothianidin/g&#x000b7;bee/day, respectively, had reduced survival over a 7-day period whereas a similar average consumption rate in workers (3.9 ng/g&#x000b7;bee/day) had no mortality effect. However, only male test populations reached 50% mortality at this clothianidin intake rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200041.g002">Fig 2</xref>) suggesting that they are slightly more sensitive to clothianidin toxicity effects than queens. The observed sex and caste differences in chronic oral toxicity of clothianidin cannot be attributed to a starvation effect as food avoidance and vomiting behaviors were not observed during the testing period. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that bumblebee reproductives (queens and males) are much more vulnerable to clothianidin toxicity effects than workers, highlighting the importance of incorporating queen and male survival assays into current colony-focused &#x02018;higher tier&#x02019; protocols for assessing the potential risk of various neonicotinoid formulations to wild bumblebee populations [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, the observed reductions in survival in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>impatiens</italic> workers chronically consuming clothianidin at a concentration of 10ppb is notably less than the 20ppb chronic lethality threshold reported for worker honeybees [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] as well as the 25ppb threshold reported for workers of the European bumblebee species <italic>B</italic>. <italic>terrestris</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], indicating that chronic oral lethality effects of clothianidin are relatively high in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>impatiens</italic>. Our findings thus add to the rapidly growing body of evidence that neonicotinoid oral toxicity effects can vary considerably among insect pollinator species [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and further show that toxicity effects can vary considerably within species as well.</p><p>In addition to increasing mortality, chronic oral exposure to clothianidin over a short time period (5 days) was found to have profound sub-lethal effects on workers and males at the genomic level, altering expression of a total of 332 genes associated with a wide variety of biological functions, including immunity, neuronal signal transduction, locomotion, reproduction, and several fundamental cellular processes (<xref rid="pone.0200041.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200041.s003">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200041.s004">S4</xref> Tables). These results are consistent with several studies at the organismal level showing that neonicotinoids can have substantial sub-lethal effects on bees [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. For example, we found that neonicotinoid consumption induced changes to several genes associated with reproduction such as outer dense fiber protein 3-like and lutropin-choriogonadotropic hormone receptor-like (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200041.s003">S3 Table</xref>), which is consistent with previous work showing that oral exposure to neonicotinoids reduces sperm viability in males honeybees by 50% [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Under natural conditions, chronic exposure to low doses of clothianidin in wildflower nectar thus has the potential to negatively impact the dynamics of wild bumblebee populations by reducing male and queen reproductive capacity and at slightly higher doses, reducing the number of mating individuals in the fall and the number of queens establishing nests in the spring.</p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, the genomic response of workers and males to sub-lethal clothianidin doses did not provide unequivocal evidence that the haploid genetic status of males renders them less able to cope with oral clothianidin exposure. Indeed, males and queens, which are diploid, responded similarly to clothianidin consumption in our feeding experiments (<xref rid="pone.0200041.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Of the 332 clothianidin-sensitive genes that were identified, 273 had a similar expression level in workers and males. These similarly expressed genes included many &#x02018;classic&#x02019; detoxification genes such as cytochrome P450s, glutathione S-transferases, and carboxylesterases [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. There was, however, some support for the haploid susceptibility hypothesis for the 19 clothianidin-induced detoxification genes found to differ between workers and males. Compared to males, workers had higher expression of all differentially expressed genes associated with Phase 2 conjugation reactions. This finding, combined with the finding that workers and males had a similar number of highly expressed Phase 1 genes related to oxidation-reduction reactions, suggests that are were equally capable of initially breaking down clothianidin into intermediate metabolites, but may differ in the capacity to subsequently transform such metabolites into less toxic compounds (Phase 2 reactions). This interpretation is consistent with reports that workers have more than twice as many constitutively expressed conjugation genes than males in a related bumblebee species, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>huntii</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, it must be noted that <italic>B</italic>. <italic>huntii</italic> workers had more than twice as many constitutively expressed Phase 1 genes than males as well. Thus, despite the fact that there was a substantial difference in the mortality response of workers and males to oral clothianidin exposure, it was not strongly correlated with the number and expression of inducible detoxification genes. Of course it is possible that haploidy in males results in the reduced expression of few key genes in the clothianidin detoxification pathway. For example, clothianidin-exposed workers showed a more than 6-fold increase in the expression of a cytochrome P450 6k1-like gene (<xref rid="pone.0200041.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which may play an integral role in neonicotinoid detoxification. We plan to explore this possibility in future work.</p><p>The present study demonstrates the potential conservation benefits of using a genomic approach to investigate the effects of extremely low doses of neonicotinoids on pollinator health, an idea that has been recently advocated by others [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Currently, one of the major problems with studying neonicotinoid effects on wild bee populations is that individual tissue samples have concentrations that are too low to be quantified with a high level of accuracy and reliability using conventional methodology and instrumentation. Indeed, the main laboratory at the United States Department of Agriculture responsible for measuring neonicotinoid levels in tissue samples was unable to detect clothianidin in our 5ppb in test solution, yet it produced a robust genetic response in both males and workers. To circumvent this problem, we have identified a set of clothianidin-induced genes in bumblebees that could potentially be used to develop highly sensitive &#x02018;eco-tools&#x02019; for assessing neonicotinoid exposure levels under field conditions. Such tools could also be used to test for sub-lethal effects on behavior (e.g. reduced cognitive function) and physiology (e.g. reduced sperm production), which are often difficult to assess in the field at the organismal level. Comparative genomic approaches would also provide unique insight into why chronic oral toxicity levels for neonicotinoids vary considerably among (and within) wild bees species [<xref rid="pone.0200041.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], greatly accelerating efforts to determine the impact of neonicotinoid use on wild pollinators and the global biodiversity that they ultimately support.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200041.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>RNA sequencing results and quality control.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200041.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200041.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Percent of alive queens, workers and males consuming test solutions (clothianidin concentration given in ppb) over the 7-day testing period.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200041.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200041.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>List of clothianidin-induced non-detoxification genes with increased expression in worker (W) and male (M) <italic>Bombus impatiens</italic>.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200041.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200041.s004"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>List of clothianidin-induced genes showing a similar expression level in worker (W) and male (M) <italic>Bombus impatiens</italic>.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200041.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p><bold>General:</bold> We thank C.
