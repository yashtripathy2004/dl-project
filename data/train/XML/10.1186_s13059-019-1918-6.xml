Moreover, <italic>local</italic>-sQTLs are more numerous in the infected state, indicating that acute stress unmasks a substantial number of silent genetic variants. We observe a general increase in intron retention concentrated at the 5&#x02032; end of transcripts across multiple strains, whose prevalence scales with the degree of pathogen virulence.

Alternative mRNA splicing is one mechanism that contributes to achieving this complex task. Among its postulated functions is an&#x000a0;increase in the repertoire of protein-coding genes through the production of multiple isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition, mRNA splicing could contribute to (post) transcriptional regulation in that transcript isoforms with the same coding potential can still feature diverse untranslated regions or alternative transcription start sites, which may affect RNA stability and/or translation efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This form of transcriptional regulation can also be affected by external stressors, notably heat shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], as first shown in <italic>Drosophila</italic> through&#x000a0;the accumulation of <italic>Hsp83</italic> and <italic>Adh</italic> pre-mRNAs at severe temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. While there are several examples of interactions between splicing and cell stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], there have been very few genome-wide studies exploring this phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">The <italic>Drosophila</italic> gut has lately attracted a lot of attention in the scientific community as a convenient system to study intestinal homeostasis in normal and diseased conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Far from being a simple digestive tube, we now know that it is a highly compartmentalized, dynamic, and immunocompetent organ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Contact with pathogenic bacteria leads to the mobilization of potent immune and stress responses, followed by homeostatic processes, all of which need to be tightly regulated. Several studies have already dissected the transcriptional programs of the innate immune system, demonstrating that a considerable level of gene regulation is achieved through the action of several transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in the innate immune response is only beginning to be appreciated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Here, we performed a systematic analysis of alternative splicing in the context of enteric infection in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. In addition to classical laboratory strains, we made use of a large RNA sequencing study of 38 inbred lines from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) to study this phenomenon in different environmental conditions and genetic backgrounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Next&#x000a0;to characterizing the effect of genetic polymorphisms, we found considerable and reproducible (i.e., genotype-independent) changes in transcript splicing following infection, with a tendency to have more intron retention and thus longer transcripts. Introns with increased retention were overrepresented at the 5&#x02032; end of transcripts and were enriched for the RNA binding motif (RBM) of Lark/RBM4. Through knockdown and overexpression of <italic>lark</italic> in adult female enterocytes, we found that <italic>lark</italic> levels can affect intron retention and modulate fly survival after enteric infection. Our work thus provides new insights into the dynamics and importance of the alternative splicing landscape during an innate immune response.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Enteric infection leads to extensive changes in transcript isoform ratios</title><p id="Par6">We used RNA-sequencing data generated from the whole guts of 38 DGRP lines that were infected with <italic>Pseudomonas entomophila</italic> (<italic>P.e.</italic>). Among these 38 lines, respectively 20 and 18 lines are susceptible and resistant to oral infection with <italic>P.e</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, we sequenced the guts of control&#x000a0;flies, which were&#x000a0;fed sucrose, for a total of 76 samples (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Since the lines are highly polymorphic, we opted to use individualized genomes and gene annotations for our analyses using available single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), indel, and structural variation data for each line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] (see the &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec12" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d; section). Given the focus of this study on gaining insights into changes in isoform composition of each gene after infection, we used a multivariate distance-based approach described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Briefly, we estimated the isoform ratios, that is, the relative ratio of alternative isoforms of each gene, using MISO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We then identified genes showing significant infection-induced differences in isoform ratios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Of the 1877 genes that passed filtering (see the &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec12" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d; section), 40% were significantly changed after infection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, <italic>p</italic> value of homogeneity &#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05, BH-corrected <italic>p</italic> value &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, effect size &#x0003e;&#x02009;0.2, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Interestingly, only 25% of the differentially spliced genes were among the 2471 genes that were differentially expressed after infection, suggesting that gene-level differential expression-type analyses may overlook important molecular aspects of the gut transcriptional response to enteric infection (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Gene ontology analysis revealed that genes associated with mRNA&#x000a0;splicing, organelle organization and biogenesis, as well as&#x000a0;tissue development are enriched within the set of differentially spliced genes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Surprisingly however, this set was not enriched for immunity terms. This may reflect different regulatory properties of genes involved in the immediate innate immune response (i.e., in the resistance mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]), many of which are significantly induced after infection, versus those involved in homeostasis (i.e., the tolerance mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]), which might be required to function in the normal and infected state. When comparing resistant and susceptible lines within each condition, we were not able to find differentially spliced genes, although some genes showed modest trends (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1a).

This is a measure of the evenness of the proportions of a gene&#x02019;s isoforms. We found that infection leads to a small but consistent increase in diversity in the infected state (<italic>p</italic> value for treatment effect on average Shannon diversity&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.7e&#x02212;05, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1b-c, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The density plot of Shannon entropies revealed that after infection, there is a bias towards increase in the number of genes with higher diversity, and consequently fewer genes with lower diversity, where across the different DGRP strains, there is an average of 20, and a maximum of 330, more genes that increase in diversity after infection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). This net increase was consistent in 37 different strains irrespective of their resistance class (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1b), suggesting that this is not a stochastic phenomenon. Interestingly, a breakdown by isoform number revealed that for genes with 2, 3, or 4 isoforms, resistant lines show a tendency for greater average diversity than susceptible lines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1c). With the exception of genes with four isoforms in the infected state (linear model <italic>p</italic> value for resistance class&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0192), this tendency is not statistically significant. These observations suggest that upon infection, the transcriptional output of many genes is less dominated by a single or few isoforms. This phenomenon is more marked in lines that are resistant to <italic>P.e.</italic> infection, which may point to a link between increased isoform diversity and greater infection resistance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The effect of natural variation on splicing increases after infection</title><p id="Par8">We have thus far established that enteric infection leads to a change in isoform abundance of a large set of genes, thereby increasing overall isoform diversity. We next sought to establish whether genetic variation affects isoform ratios. To this end, we identified local splicing quantitative trait loci (<italic>local-</italic>sQTLs) in the two infection states using sQTLseekeR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We restricted our analysis to SNPs within a 10-kb window around each gene (see the &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec12" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d; section), hence our annotation of &#x0201c;<italic>local-</italic>sQTLs&#x0201d;. We identified 359 and 646 control- and infection-specific <italic>local-</italic>sQTLs, and 282 <italic>local-</italic>sQTLs that are common to both conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Interestingly, there were around 80% more <italic>local-</italic>sQTLs in the infected state, affecting more than twice as many genes as in the control state (96 vs. 39 genes) although a similar number of genes were tested in the two conditions (1238 vs 1248 for controls and infected, respectively). In addition, a greater percentage of genes with a <italic>local-</italic>sQTL in the infected state showed significant differences in isoform ratios upon infection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). These results demonstrate that inter-strain differences in isoform ratios can be attributed to alterations in the genomic DNA sequence and that enteric infection unmasks a substantial amount of otherwise silent genetic variants that affect splicing.

A null distribution of the percentage overlap was produced by randomly sampling variants within gene bodies with a similar allele frequency distribution as the <italic>local-</italic>sQTLs. This was repeated 100 times and the percentage, as well as the mean (blue solid line) and standard deviations (dashed lines) were computed. A solid line shows the maximum overlap obtained through random permutations</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2019_1918_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">To gain insights into which biological processes are enriched in the genes that have <italic>local-</italic>sQTLs, we performed separate gene ontology enrichment of the three sets of genes: control, infected, and shared <italic>local-</italic>sQTLs genes. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b shows a combined graphical representation of the three GO enrichment results. In the control state, we observed an enrichment of GO terms related to cellular and nitrogen compound metabolic processes. In the infected state, other categories emerged, namely cellular response to stress, cell cycle, and aging. As in the enrichment for infection-induced splicing changes, we did not find any enrichment for immune-related processes, but mostly homeostatic mechanisms. This could either mean that splicing is not a major regulator of canonical immunity pathways or that there is strong selective pressure against genetic variation that affects splicing in immunity-related genes.</p><p id="Par10">Next, we examined the location of the detected <italic>local</italic>-sQTLs in relation to their respective genes. We used a gene-centric and intron-centric approach to obtain metaplots. Since natural variation density along genes is not uniform, and tends to be higher towards the 5&#x02032; ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], we generated a null distribution by considering sets of randomly selected variants that are located within 10&#x02009;kb around genes and that have a matching allele frequency spectrum to the <italic>local-</italic>sQTLs. We found that both the null and the observed <italic>local-</italic>sQTL distributions show a peak around the TSS of genes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2a). However, while the null distribution had a single symmetrical peak with wide tails, the <italic>local-</italic>sQTL density one had a higher density at the main 5&#x02032; end, as well as an elevated plateau along the metagene body. This density distribution could be the reflection of multiple possible effects of variants on isoform ratios. One such effect is at the DNA level, where alternative TSS selection could be affected by variants around the 5&#x02032; end. Other effects can be through directly modulating splicing all along the transcript. A third type can be modulating transcript stability, which can also be located anywhere on the gene body.</p><p id="Par11">To gain further insights into how <italic>local-</italic>sQTLs could be mediating differences in splicing, we also calculated the <italic>local-</italic>sQTL density distribution around introns as well as a respective null distribution. Interestingly, we observed a pattern that is very distinct from the null distribution. While the latter showed a wide peak that is centered around the 5&#x02032; end of introns, the <italic>local-</italic>sQTL distribution exhibited a sharp peak at the 5&#x02032; end, with a much greater density of sQTLs immediately upstream compared to downstream of the intron (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2a). In addition, the number of sQTLs dropped sharply at the boundaries of introns. As may have been expected, these data support the notion that genetic variants that affect splicing largely act by inducing differences in the processes that are required for splicing, predominantly around the 5&#x02032; splice site. One such <italic>local-</italic>sQTL example is in the gene <italic>Psi</italic>, which has a <italic>local-</italic>sQTL at a splice site (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2b-d). Lines with different alleles at this locus showed markedly different splicing patterns, with a clear shift in the major isoform produced in both conditions. However, not all <italic>local-</italic>sQTLs could be assigned such a direct mechanism of action, as some might have more subtle effects, for example by affecting exonic and intronic splicing enhancers (ESEs and ISEs) that affect the recruitment of RNA binding factors. To assess this possibility, we asked whether it is more likely that a <italic>local-</italic>sQTL overlaps with an ESE or ISE. Since these splicing enhancer sequences are short hexamers, predicting them along the genome produces many false positives. Nevertheless, we considered a set of 330 published enhancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and looked for matches along all the gene bodies (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). We then counted the overlap between the <italic>local-</italic>sQTLs and 100 random sets of variants with a matching allele frequency spectrum. Interestingly, 70% of the <italic>local-</italic>sQTLs overlapped a predicted enhancer, which is 10% higher and 6.1 standard deviations away from the mean of random samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e). This enrichment indicates that some of the <italic>local-</italic>sQTLs that lie within ESEs and ISEs could be mediating isoform ratios by affecting splicing enhancer function. Taken together, our <italic>local-</italic>sQTL data shows that we can detect effects of natural variation on splicing, even more in the infected state, and suggests that these effects are due to direct changes in splice sites, as well as other mechanisms predominantly at or around the splice donor site. These results also again indicate that splicing changes in the infected state are regulated processes and not merely a result of stochastic perturbations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Post-infection transcripts tend to be longer, mainly because of longer 5&#x02032;UTRs</title><p id="Par12">We next sought to characterize the effect of the splicing changes on the length of the produced transcripts. To do so, we estimated an effective length measure for each gene. Briefly, for each gene in each sample, we estimated the effective gene length as the weighted mean of its individual transcripts (taking indels of individual lines into account) by the isoform ratios (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Similarly, we extended this method to specific regions within the transcript, namely the 5&#x02032;UTR, 3&#x02032;UTR, and the coding sequence. We then compared the effective length before and after infection to determine the number of genes with an increased, decreased, or unchanged effective length (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). We generated a null distribution of effective length differences by performing 100 permutations of the data, by randomly assigning infection status to the samples, and compared this to our observed set using G-tests. The effect of indels on the coefficient of variation in feature length&#x02014;that is when we calculate the effect that indels have on the sequence length in the DGRPs without taking expression levels into account&#x02014;was most prominent in 3&#x02032;UTRs. However, when we factor in isoform ratios, and calculate the variation in effective lengths, 5&#x02032;UTRs showed the highest variation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3a, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>). 3&#x02032;UTR lengths deviated the most from the null distribution, and their infection-induced differences were lower than expected. However, the proportion of those that increased in effective length was close to those that decreased in response to infection (23.2% vs. 24.1 respectively, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3b-c). Furthermore, by classifying genes based on how 3&#x02032;UTRs may affect their effective length, we found no difference in the contribution of polyadenylation site usage and splicing (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3d). In contrast to the 3&#x02032;UTR, we found that around 7% more genes increase rather than decrease in transcript and 5&#x02032;UTR effective length (paired <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic> values&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.9e&#x02212;05 and 1.2e&#x02212;06 respectively). Predicted polypeptide length, however, did not show differences from the null distribution nor any skew. Importantly, the distribution of this shift in effective length was consistent across the DGRP lines, with transcripts and 5&#x02032;UTRs having an excess of increased effective lengths, thus supporting that this is a reproducible and genotype-independent phenomenon (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3b-c). To show which feature contributes to the effective length change the most, we performed a similar analysis, this time calculating the infection-induced change in transcript effective length after the removal of a specific feature. We found that the removal of 5&#x02032;UTR length and not the predicted polypeptide nor 3&#x02032;UTR abolished this skew in the proportions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). Together, these results suggest that infection-induced differences in isoform ratios preferentially affect 5&#x02032;UTRs and favor the production of isoforms with longer 5&#x02032;UTRs across genotypes.

Using an available annotation that is specific to intron retention events from the MISO annotation website, we estimated the percent spliced-in (PSI or &#x003a8;) value for each of the 32,895 introns using MISO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). This annotation was established based on RNA sequencing of 30 whole animal samples from 27 distinct development stages as part of the modENCODE project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The reliance on two sources of annotations, a gene-centric one with full transcript isoforms from Ensembl and intron-centric one, renders the task of mapping the effect of changes in individual events on whole isoform abundance non-trivial, especially when using short-read sequencing. A limitation that we therefore acknowledge is that not all intron retention events can be directly mapped to an annotated gene. However, despite this limitation, we hypothesized that if a systematic and consistent increase in intron retention based on intron-centric annotations is detected, this may explain why transcripts tend to be longer after infection.

In contrast to steady-state analyses, our population-level data from two conditions allowed us to investigate infection-induced changes in intron retention and whether they are restricted to specific transcripts or reflect mere random splicing events. We thereby defined introns with increased retention as introns that significantly increase in PSI (positive delta PSI, bayes factor&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10) whereas introns with reduced intron retention are those that significantly decrease in PSI (negative delta PSI, bayes factor&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10). As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, we uncovered a large number of introns with increased retention (535) and decreased retention (331) that are significant in at least 5 DGRP lines (bayes factor&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10, delta psi&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.2, also see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4a-b). These data thus suggest that DGRP strains react similarly to infection. For instance, among the 535 events with increased intron retention in 5 strains, 510 never decreased in retention, 13 decreased in one DGRP strain, 11 in two strains, and one in four strains. Moreover, using the R package SuperExactTest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], we found that the overlap of introns with increased retention between strains was highly significant. For example, the expected overlap in two and four DGRP lines is less than 10 and 0.001 events, respectively, whereas the median observed overlap was 133 and 59, again suggesting non-random RNA splicing changes. Interestingly, there were 1.6 times more events with a positive compared to a negative delta PSI (535 vs 331 respectively), indicating a net increase in retention post-infection.</p><p id="Par15">It is not clear whether the observed intron retention change is specific to <italic>P.e</italic> and whether different pathogens induce a similar response. We addressed this point by generating paired-end RNA-sequencing data of adult female guts of the widely used <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> strain infected with the lethal <italic>P.e.</italic> and a non-lethal pathogen, <italic>Erwinia carotovora carotovora 15</italic> (<italic>Ecc15</italic>). Adult female flies were either fed with sucrose (1.5X), <italic>P.e</italic> (OD<sub>600</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;100 and 1.5X sucrose), or <italic>Ecc15</italic> (OD<sub>600</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;100 and 1.5X sucrose). When we compared the two infection conditions to the uninfected control state, we found that both conditions differed from the control in intron retention events (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c, d, 493 and 200 events in <italic>P.e.</italic> and <italic>Ecc15</italic> respectively, bayes factor&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10, delta psi&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.2). In addition, we found a high degree of overlap among the DGRP lines, as well as between the DGRP and the <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e), supporting the notion that this phenomenon deterministically affects a specific set of introns.

While we only tested infection as an insult in this study, we nevertheless speculate that other interventions may lead to similar changes in splicing. Thus, we postulate that infection-induced splicing differences occur in response to different pathogens, and scale with the degree of virulence, infection severity, or stress.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Introns with increased retention have exon-like characteristics and are enriched for known RNA-binding motifs</title><p id="Par16">We next aimed at characterizing the retained and spliced introns. A meta-analysis of the location of introns with increased and decreased retention showed that the density of introns with increased retention is very high at the 5&#x02032; end of transcripts, which partly explains why longer UTRs are being produced after infection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). We then compared their length and GC content, both of which are known parameters that determine exon and intron specification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In terms of length, introns with increased retention tend to be shorter than the ones with decreased retention (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5a). In addition, their GC content tends to be higher, and consequently, the difference in GC content between the introns and their flanking exons was lower (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). Next, we performed RNA Polymerase II ChIP-seq on female guts under control and infected conditions to consider its intron occupancy as an additional characterization parameter (see the &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec12" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d; section). Interestingly, we found that introns with increased retention also show greater enrichment for RNA polymerase II irrespective of treatment condition (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5b, see the &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec12" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d; section). We did not find any enrichment of biological processes for the genes affected by intron retention. Together, these results suggest that retained introns tend to exhibit exon-like characteristics. To formally and independently validate this hypothesis, we overlaid a list of experimentally verified <italic>Drosophila</italic> upstream Open Reading Frames (uORFs) with our data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

We therefore assessed enrichment of RNA-binding motif (RBM) sites in the introns with decreased and increased retention, using as background those introns that did not change significantly. We used AME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], from the MEME suite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], to determine enrichment of experimentally derived RBMs in the sequences of introns and the 50 bases flanking them from each side [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

Furthermore, upon scanning for motif sequences in these introns, we observed that introns with increased retention not only have more predicted motif binding sites, as expected because of their longer sequences, but also tend to have more motif matches close to the introns&#x02019; 5&#x02032; splice site.

To further address this hypothesis, we focused on Lark, since its RBM was the most enriched in the sequences of introns with increased retention, and investigated its possible involvement in the gut&#x02019;s response to infection. Lark is the ortholog of human RBM4, an RNA-binding protein implicated in splicing, translation, and the stress response. In humans, it has been shown to be activated through phosphorylation by the p38 MAPK pathway in response to stress, where it shuttles out of the nucleus and affects translation of different targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

An organism must quickly and reversibly adapt to the challenge to ensure survival. Transcription factors that act in response to stimuli, such as Relish (the IMD pathway), Atf-2 (MAPK pathway), and STAT92E (JAK/STAT pathway), have all been studied in the context of gut infection, damage, and regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and we and others have characterized the regulatory function of those transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, another major aspect of transcriptional regulation, splicing, has so far been largely ignored. Here, we present the first characterization of the splicing differences that occur after enteric infection by using a genetic reference panel of flies as well as standard laboratory strains. We found that infection induces widespread and consistent splicing changes in 38 <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains. Only 25% of the genes in our data that exhibited significant infection-induced splicing differences were also differentially expressed after infection. This suggests that splicing is another, so far underappreciated, component in the organism&#x02019;s defense against enteric pathogens through the generation of molecular diversity. This is in line with our observation of a consistent increase in isoform species diversity, as measured by the Shannon diversity index, after infection. This diversity might be favored in times of cellular stress, expanding the cell&#x02019;s repertoire of transcriptional products. Intriguingly, this increased diversity is also coupled to an increase in splicing QTLs. The identification of twice as many <italic>local-</italic>sQTLs in the infected state as well as their relative location with respect to genes points to an important role for genetic variation in shaping the gut response to infection. This opens up the possibility that genetic predisposition to stress can be mediated through altered levels of splicing, even though we observed only mild differences in splicing between susceptible and resistant lines. We thereby note that, since our analyses rely on existing annotations of full transcripts, we cannot rule out the possibility that these annotations may be incomplete or that local genetic variation may lead to the expression of novel isoforms. Nevertheless, it is likely that our identified sQTLs on annotated isoform abundance are still valid indicators of genetically driven differences in splicing, yet the exact number of isoforms and the contribution of individual splicing events on the ratios may not be completely accurate. Altogether, we believe that variation in gut immunocompetence cannot be explained by a single pathway or mechanism given the multifaceted and complex nature of this phenotype, but rather by a combination of different factors of which splicing may be another important one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Since we are sequencing poly-A enriched RNA, and not nascent RNA, this diversity increase can possibly be explained by the presence of a mixture of pre-infection and post-infection mRNA species in the same cell and/or by an increased heterogeneity across cells. Other hypotheses can be equally valid. For instance, it could be the result of a general loss of fidelity of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, leading to an increase in molecular noise. Studies in human cell lines have shown that noisy splicing is a common feature of genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Studies in yeast have shown that gene expression noise confers a fitness advantage after acute severe stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], much like our infection model. Indeed, we observed fewer splicing differences and intron retention after <italic>Ecc15</italic> infection, a non-lethal enteric pathogen. However, our findings clearly revealed that infection leads to consistent differences in splicing and intron retention across genotypes and types of pathogens. This observation argues against the increased-noise theory and in favor of a deterministic process that may constitute a more general response to stress, thus beyond the infection model used here.</p><p id="Par24">Our findings on the extent and nature of introns with increased retention are consistent with earlier work showing that widespread intron retention in humans and mouse samples under steady-state conditions is coupled to RNA Pol II pausing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In addition, reduced intron length and higher GC content were revealed as predictors of intron retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Nascent RNA-sequencing experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells and whole heads, in steady-state, have shown that intron retention tends to be higher in the first intron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Indeed, many of the infection-induced changes in our analyses are at the 5&#x02032; end of transcripts, including the 5&#x02032;UTRs, which means that infection-induced splicing changes could have more of a regulatory rather than coding function. A large portion of retained introns may thereby function as uORFs given our observation that introns with increased retention have a greater likelihood of overlapping with experimentally mapped uORFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] compared to introns with decreased retention. Since uORFs have been shown in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to mostly modulate CDS translation efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], we speculate that the major regulatory function of such uORFs in introns with infection-induced retention is to negatively affect protein translation initiation by competing for ribosomes. Inhibition of translation is a well-documented aspect of the gut response to pathogenic bacteria, so far shown to be mediated by the activation of the GCN2 kinase and subsequent phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1;, which in turn results into limited translation initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. It is thus conceptually intuitive that the observed intron retention program may act as a complementary process to modulating protein translation in response to infection. This may be especially true for specific gene sets including those coding for splicing factors themselves, which tend to be particularly affected by intron retention across systems and species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Nevertheless, the ultimate consequence of intron retention may well be gene- and context-specific as uORFs have also been shown to promote translation such as is the case for the stress-linked transcription factors ATF4 and ATF5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. More integrative and targeted proteome or ribosome profiling studies will be required to inform on these different scenarios.</p><p id="Par25">The observation that introns with increased retention are enriched for the Lark motif led us to investigate the involvement of Lark in the gut defense response. In the fly, this gene has mostly been studied in the context of circadian&#x000a0;biology and eye development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In mammals, however, several reports have been published implicating its orthologue, RBM4, in the response to stress through regulation of splicing, transcript stability, and translation control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In this study, we found that enteric infection increased <italic>lark</italic> levels, but surprisingly, both lower and higher levels of <italic>lark</italic>, compared to controls, enhanced infection resistance, implying dosage sensitivity. Nevertheless, modulating <italic>lark</italic> levels alone was sufficient to affect intron retention, especially in Lark RBM-enriched introns, irrespective of infection status. These findings therefore identify Lark as a mediator of both infection-induced splicing differences as well as resistance to infection, but the precise relationship between these two processes warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par26">In this study, we were able to implicate Lark in infection-induced splicing differences, as well as resistance to infection, but many questions remain unanswered.

Moreover, the factors controlling <italic>lark</italic> expression and induction in the gut are still unknown. Finally, it is not clear whether the action of Lark is a general stress response or whether its action is adapted to the nature and severity of the stimulus.

To address whether 3&#x02032;UTR effective length changes were due to differential polyadenylation site use versus splicing, we devised a strategy to classify multi-isoform genes into these two groups. We used simple rules to decide whether 3&#x02032;UTRs of that gene (1) can contribute to diversity in the first place, (2) have the same number of exons, and (3) share a common start position and different end position.

If all the transcripts&#x02019; 3&#x02032;UTRs have the same number of exons, and these exons share the same start position but different end position, we put the gene in the &#x0201c;Alternate3Poly&#x0201d; category.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>sQTL analysis</title><p id="Par41">sQTL analysis was performed using sQTLSeekR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] using the transcript ratios and genetic variants 10&#x02009;kb around each expressed gene with multiple isoforms. We performed slight modifications on the package script in order to extract information about the effect size of sQTLs which was normally calculated but not reported.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>ESE and ISE analyses</title><p id="Par42">We used a published set of 330 intronic and exonic splicing enhancers and pattern matching through the BSgenome and Biostrings R packages to catalogue all the possible locations of those elements within the gene bodies of the reference genome. We then calculated the percentage of sQTLs that overlap with a predicted element. To assess the overlap expected by chance, we randomly sampled, 100 times, sets of variants that are within 10&#x02009;kb of expressed genes that have a similar allele frequency spectrum as the sQTLs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>RNA-binding motif analyses</title><p id="Par43">We used AME version 4.11.1, from the MEME suite, to perform enrichment of all binding motifs of RNA binding proteins using <italic>Drosophila</italic>-specific PWM scores from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] in introns with increased and decreased retention. The same RNA-binding protein can have multiple RBMs. We used FIMO, also from the MEME suite, for motif scanning using the same set of PWMs. Given that the retained introns were poorly enriched for RBMs and in order to visualize the locations of motifs in both the introns with increased and decreased retention, we used a high FDR threshold of 40% to filter the resulting matches and only kept the motifs that are enriched in the AME results (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5d,e). For both AME and FIMO analyses, we used the sequences of introns that do not change significantly, that is, introns that are neither spliced nor retained after infection, as background.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Overlap with uORF</title><p id="Par44">We used supplementary data table 2 from the study of Zhang and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We converted coordinates from R6 to R5 using the Flybase Coordinates Back-Converter. We only kept uORFs that are less than 201&#x02009;bp in length which left us with 32,924 out of 37,619. We looked for any overlap between introns and the uORFs based on the reference locations; then for each DGRP line, we split the intron events by the sign of their PSI value and counted the proportion of those events that have a uORF. To test for significance, we performed a paired one-tailed <italic>t</italic> test between the positive and negative logit-transformed proportions.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec33"><p>
