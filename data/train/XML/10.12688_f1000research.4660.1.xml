<sup>2+</sup> influx through the NMDA-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) and the resulting activation of the Ca
<sup>2+</sup> and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII). Ca
<sup>2+</sup> influx via the NMDAR triggers CaMKII binding to the NMDAR for enhanced CaMKII accumulation at post-synaptic sites that experience heightened activity as occurring during LTP. Previously, we generated knock-in (KI) mice in which we replaced two residues in the NMDAR GluN2B subunit to impair CaMKII binding to GluN2B. Various forms of LTP at the Schaffer collateral synapses in CA1 are reduced by 50%. Nevertheless, working memory in the win-shift 8 arm maze and learning of the Morris water maze (MWM) task was normal in the KI mice although recall of the task was impaired in these mice during the period of early memory consolidation. We now show that massed training in the MWM task within a single day resulted in impaired learning. However, learning and recall of the Barnes maze task and contextual fear conditioning over one or multiple days were surprisingly unaffected. The differences observed in the MWM compared to the Barnes maze and contextual fear conditioning suggest a differential involvement of CaMKII and the specific interaction with GluN2B, probably depending on varying degrees of stress, cognitive demand or even potentially different plasticity mechanisms associated with the diverse tasks.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id>NS046450</award-id><award-id>NS078792</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by NIH grants NS046450 and NS078792 to JWH.</funding-statement><funding-statement><italic>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</italic></funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The acquisition and storage of new tasks as well as the modification of already existing memories depend on the selective strengthening and weakening of synaptic interactions embedded in extensive networks of neurons (

After the acclimation period and before the training and testing the mice were extensively handled (7&#x02013;10 times for 1&#x02013;2 min on different days). All trainings and testing were performed during the 12 h light cycle.</p></sec><sec><title>Morris water maze</title><p>The MWM was a circular, enamel coated steel tank, 94 cm in diameter filled with water at 22&#x02013;24&#x000b0;C. For the visible trial, a black labeled square platform (6 &#x000d7; 6 cm) emerging 2 cm out of the opaque (through addition of non-toxic paint) water surface was used, while the clear Plexiglas square platform (6 &#x000d7; 6 cm) for the training trials was submerged 2 cm below the opaque water surface. On the first day, the mice were trained in one visible trial followed by 12 consecutive training trials, while the platform was kept in a fixed position. The mice were always placed facing the wall of the pool and started randomly from three different starting positions that are equally distributed around the perimeter and are not located within the target quadrant. The mice were allowed to swim freely for 90 s to find the platform. If they failed to locate the platform within time, they were gently guided to it. After the mice climbed on the platform they were allowed to remain 30 s on the platform before they were removed from the pool and placed in their home cage for an inter-trial interval of 6&#x02013;10 min. The mice were returned to the pool for a 90 s probe test without the platform 1 day and 7 days after the training day. The training session and probe trials were monitored and analyzed using the SMART (Version 2.5.19) real-time video-tracking system.</p></sec><sec><title>Barnes maze</title><p>The Barnes maze was executed according to (

In short, the maze consisted of a circular platform (92 cm diameter; opaque white) with 20 equally spaced holes (5 cm diameter; 7.5 cm between holes) and was elevated 105 cm above the floor. All holes were 2 cm away from the perimeter of the platform and a dark escape box (10 cm &#x000d7; 12.5 cm &#x000d7; 12.5 cm) was located beneath one of the holes.</p><p>The mouse was placed in a cylindrical black start chamber (10 cm &#x000d7; 12.5 cm &#x000d7; 12.5 cm) in the middle of the maze. After 10 s the chamber was lifted and the mouse was exposed to bright light (500 W). For the habituation trial on day 1 the animal was gently guided to the escape box and once it entered, the entry hole was covered and the mouse kept for 2 min in the dark escape box. Between each mouse, before the next trial, the platform was cleaned with a 10% Nolvasan solution to avoid remaining olfactory cues. During the acquisition phase, after the start chamber was lifted, the mouse was allowed to explore the maze for 3 min. The trial ended when the mouse entered the escape box or after 3 min had elapsed. Immediately after the mouse entered the escape box, the entry hole was covered and the animal stayed for 1 min in the dark escape box. If the mouse did not reach the target hole/escape box within 3 min, it was gently guided to it. After 1 min in the escape box, the mouse was placed back in its home cage until the next trial. Each mouse received 4 training trials per day with an inter-trial interval of 10&#x02013;15 min on 4 consecutive days.</p><p>The probe trial was conducted on day 5, i.e., 24 h after the last training day, and on day 12. During the probe test the escape box was removed and the mouse was allowed to explore the maze for a fixed time of 90 s. The number of pokes (errors) in each hole and the latency and path length to reach the virtual target hole was measured using the SMART (Version 2.5.19) real-time video-tracking system.</p></sec><sec><title>Elevated plus maze</title><p>The elevated plus maze (EPM) was a four arm maze with each arm measuring 30 &#x000d7; 5 cm and the central platform measured 5 &#x000d7; 5 cm (opaque white). One set of arms, opposing one another, were enclosed completely by grey side walls, 15 cm high, while the other set was open with a ledge of 0.5 cm on either side of the arms. The maze was elevated 100 cm from the floor and illuminated evenly with a 500W light. Mice were placed on the central platform, facing towards a closed arm, and allowed to freely explore the maze for 5 min. The SMART (Version 2.5.19) real-time tracking software was used to record the locomotor activity and the time spent on both the closed and the open arms during the test.</p></sec><sec><title>Fear conditioning</title><p>Contextual fear conditioning was conducted using the &#x02018;Video Tracking of Fear Conditioning System&#x02019; and the &#x02018;Video Freeze Software&#x02019; from MED Associates Inc. The experimentally na&#x000ef;ve mice were placed in the conditioning chamber and received the first foot shock at the end of a 3 min habituation period. The mice remained for an additional minute in the chamber after the last foot shock was delivered. For the 5 shock conditioning protocol, the mice received an electric foot shock (0.75 mA, 1 s) at the end of the 3

In case of the milder 3 shock paradigm and the 4 day training protocol the mice were pre-exposed to the conditioning chamber for 3 min and 10 min respectively. For recall the mice were placed back for 5 min in the same chamber after the indicated periods of time. If the mice were exposed to a different context, the chamber geometry was changed (from square to curved wall), the lights were dimmed, the rod-flooring was covered with white linoleum, and the scent was changed from 0.01% bleach to bubble gum. Using the Video Freeze Program, the freezing time was determined (in %) and was defined as the absence of any movement, except for respiratory motion. The observed freezing response to the foot shock is correlated to the degree of learning, the strength of the aversive stimulus, and the number of presentations (

<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Halt
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), two independent cohorts of GluN2B KI mice and their WT littermate controls (10 mice of each genotype per cohort) underwent a massed training protocol on a single day in the MWM. Such a compressed training protocol challenges the learning capacity within a short time period. It also has the potential to reveal deficits in early- versus late-phase consolidation as training is not protracted over 6 days as is the case for the classic MWM. The 1 day protocol thus might expose deficits in early consolidation when testing different cohorts 1 and 7 days after the training day without the complication that in the 6 days training paradigm training and consolidation processes overlap. After habituation on the first day (training day), mice underwent one visible platform trial followed by 12 consecutive training trials, in which the platform was no longer visible but kept in a fixed position. The initial trial with a marked visible platform is hippocampus-independent and was conducted to rule out changes in motivation, coordination, or sensory processing in GluN2B KI mice. The latency in reaching the visible platform was not different between the two genotypes (

In a number of studies CaMKII&#x003b1; KO and mutant mice displayed learning deficits, notably mainly in aversively motivated tasks (

<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Carvalho
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Moreover, the regulation of expression or activity level of CaMKII&#x003b1; seems to have an emotional component and especially impact emotional and anxiety-like behavior and learning. CaMKII&#x003b1; heterozygous KO mice show a decreased freezing in fear conditioning induced by an electric foot shock and are more active in the open field suggesting decreased anxiety-related behaviors (
<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Chen
<italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). Consistently, transgenic mice overexpressing CaMKII&#x003b1; exhibit an increase in anxiety-like behaviors in open field, light-dark transition, and elevated zero maze (
<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Hasegawa
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). CaMKII&#x003b1; T286A mutant mice, which are deficient in autonomous and thereby overall CaMKII activity, spend more time in and entered more often the open arm in the EPM and generally react with hyperactivity to novel stimuli that could be perceived as potentially threatening (
<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Easton
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). However, the behavior in the non-threatening neutral environment of the home cage is normal (
<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Easton
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), in accordance with an impaired learning in MWM and fear conditioning (
<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Giese
<italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Irvine
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) but a normal appetitive instrumental conditioning (
<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Carvalho
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Results in our study concur with these findings and argue for the specific importance of CaMKII binding to GluN2B in aversive and more demanding spatial learning task of the MWM, with the less threatening and stressful Barnes maze task being unaffected in the KI mice. Contextual fear conditioning and memory was surprisingly not affected in the GluN2B KI mice. We assume that this discrepancy is due to the higher demands of the MWM task and the differential regulation of spatial and contextual LTM formation (
<xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Mizuno &#x00026; Giese, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Learning during massed training sessions, i.e., when training trials are given in short order on a single day, generally results in lower levels of learning than spaced training over a period of several days. For instance, in the MWM rats showed faster and better acquisition during spaced (16 trials over 4 days) than massed training (16 trials in 1 day) as well as better memory formation (
<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Commins
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). During contextual fear conditioning 1 h spaced training also results in better memory formation than massed training, while cued fear conditioning is unaffected (
<xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Scharf
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Likely because of the more demanding task of massed training, which requires information being stored during a shorter time period than in spaced training, the GluN2B KI mice revealed a mild learning deficit compared to WT mice in the 1 day paradigm (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) when they did not in the 6 day MWM training protocol (
<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Halt
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref> shows that there is no difference in the swim speed between WT and KI mice, which together with the increased covered distance of the KI mice during the last two trials (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>) argues against the differences in agility and fatigue in the GluN2B KI. The increased covered distance shows that the KI mice have to swim longer and cover a greater distance in order to find the platform during the later trials, further supporting the extended primary escape latency (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>) and therefore the KI learning deficit. The learning deficit in the 1 day paradigm suggests that the learning capacity over a more limited time period is reduced in GluN2B KI mice. In addition, the elevated stress level during the massed training in the 1 day protocol could affect learning in the GluN2B KI mice more than in WT contributing to the differential outcome.</p><p>The GluN2B KI phenotype is similar to alpha and delta CREB KO mice, which are impaired in massed but not in spaced MWM learning and contextual fear conditioning (
<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Kogan
<italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). The improvement in memory after spaced learning is also mimicked in acute hippocampal slices where successive spaced theta burst stimulation resulted in enhanced previously saturated LTP (
<xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Kramar
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In the study by Kramar
<italic>et al.</italic> the induction of LTP in a subset of synapses during the first theta burst train primed the initially unresponsive neighbors (probably in a translation-dependent manner, since the two stimulations have to be spaced 1 h apart; see also (
<xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Scharf
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>)), resulting in potentiation after stimulation with the second theta burst train. This mechanism will probably be especially important in cases of impaired LTP induction or expression like in our GluN2B KI mice where various forms of LTP were reduced by ~50% (
<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Halt
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The Barnes maze is a demanding spatial task using visual cues in the room for navigation, which is in that regard similar to the MWM. One major difference between these two spatial learning paradigms is probably the amount of stress to which animals are exposed. The unaffected performance of the GluN2B KI mice in the less stressful Barnes Maze is in line with the known importance of CaMKII selectively in aversive rather than appetitive motivated spatial and contextual learning paradigms (
<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Elgersma

<italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Silva
<italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>). However, further potential differences include sensory processes and response requirements, which cannot be excluded as a reason for the deficit in massed MWM learning compared to no deficit in the Barnes maze (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Fear conditioning, on the other hand, creates a high level of anxiety. Compared to spatial learning paradigms like the MWM, the contextual conditioning only requires memorization of a far less complex environment, which only has to be recognized and does not require navigation and localization of a certain target. Additionally, at the beginning of the conditioning the mice have time to explore and form a spatial map without being stressed or more anxious than during the normal exposure to a novel environment, before the first shock is delivered at the end of the 3
<sup>rd</sup> minute. During the milder conditioning paradigm (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>) the mice were pre-exposed to the shocking chamber on the previous day, which allowed the formation of an even better spatial representation (
<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Fanselow, 2000</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Frankland
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Hu
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). This lack of a demanding spatial learning requirement and possible formation of contextual memory during still low stress levels could explain the normal conditioning and contextual memory (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref> and
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>) compared to the moderate learning deficit observed during massed MWM training (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, fear conditioning in general constitutes a very strong learning paradigm, which might override and mask any mild learning deficits because of its vigor even in the mildest form tested here. In support of this idea the five tone-shock pairings allow full fear conditioning in CaMKII T286A mutant mice when one and three pairings do not (
<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Irvine
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Irvine
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Accordingly, the strength of conditioning can mask learning deficits, and for GluN2B KI mice that might even be the case for single shock experiments. Spatial and contextual LTM formation is differently regulated. There are not only divergent regional requirements within the hippocampus, but also the control of gene transcription varies between spatial and contextual LTM formation (
<xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Mizuno &#x00026; Giese, 2005</xref>). Accordingly, MWM and fear conditioning could depend on molecular mechanisms that vary in detail even though both learning paradigms require CaMKII.</p><p>Contrasting CaMKII&#x003b1; heterozygous KO, T286A KI mice, or transgenic mice overexpressing CaMKII&#x003b1;, the GluN2B KI mice display no change in basal anxiety levels or anxiety-like behaviors. They show avoidance of the open arms in the EPM (

<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Halt

<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Halt
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), a measure of innate fear, that are comparable to WT mice. Thus it appears that CaMKII&#x003b1; affects fear behavior independent of its binding to GluN2B.</p><p>Our study suggests a specific requirement for the activity-dependent interaction of CaMKII with the NMDAR during the acquisition of more elaborate spatial learning tasks under modestly aversive, stressful conditions. The results argue not only for a role of CaMKII binding to GluN2B during consolidation (
<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Halt
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), but also for learning, which becomes obvious under the here applied more demanding MWM conditions. The less stressful Barnes maze neither results in a consolidation deficit nor is the learning itself affected. In addition, the less demanding but more potent contextual fear conditioning and memory was surprisingly normal. Whether reduced recall of the MWM task 1 and 7 days after single day training reflects reduced learning, reduced memory consolidation, or both cannot be answered at this point.</p></sec><sec><title>Data availability</title><p>F1000Research: Dataset 1.

<bold>Summary:</bold>&#x000a0;This study substantially extends the previous behavioral analysis of a mouse line with mutant GluN2B that is incapable of CaMKII binding. Individually, both GluN2B and CaMKII are critically involved in regulating synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. Previous studies from the same lab showed that the mutant GluN2B KI mice have impaired hippocampal CA1 LTP (reduced to ~50%) and impaired recall during the consolidation phase of a Morris water maze (MWM) task
<sup><xref rid="rep-ref-5919-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Here, learning impairments were found in a modified MWM task that involves massed learning during day 1. All other learning paradigms tested here or previously were normal. Basal behavior was also extensively evaluated, and was found to be normal in all tasks tested here or previously.</p><p>
<bold>Evaluation:</bold>&#x000a0;The manuscript is very well written. The experiments and the analyses are solid. The interpretation and discussion of the results are both careful and insightful. Overall, it can be very reasonably concluded that learning requires the CaMKII/GluN2B interaction only when the learning task is rather difficult and/or involves some stress (such as in a water maze), consistent also with impaired but not abolished LTP in these mice.</p><p>
<bold>Comments:</bold>&#x000a0;The conclusions from this study may also inform potential future behavioral studies on these mice. For instance, while the GluN2B KI mice were normal in multiple variations of contextual fear conditioning, the contextual part of the task was made rather easy in all paradigms tested. However, even with shorter exposure to the context, fear conditioning may still be too easy of a learning task to reveal any differences in the GluN2B mice. Thus, while such future studies may be interesting, either outcome would still be consistent with the conclusions reached here.</p><p>The behavioral analyses of the GluN2B KI mice were done specifically in order to evaluate the impact of the LTP impairments in these mice. When comparing the GluN2B KI mice with CaMKII T286A or CaMKII knock-out mice in other behavioral tasks in future studies, it may have to be taken into account that the GluN2B KI mice are impaired only in LTP, while the CaMKII mutant mice are additionally impaired in LTD.</p><p>
<bold>One point in which my opinion differs</bold>&#x000a0;is within the introduction, specifically regarding the statement that
<italic>&#x0201c;auto-phosphorylation on T286 is required for effective binding of CaMKII to GluN2B&#x0201d;</italic>. The cited references could indeed be interpreted support this statement
<sup><xref rid="rep-ref-5919-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
<sup><xref rid="rep-ref-5919-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. However, newer data indicate that the increased binding observed after ATP addition was largely caused by direct nucleotide binding to the kinase, rather than by auto-phosphorylation
<sup><xref rid="rep-ref-5919-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>
<sup><xref rid="rep-ref-5919-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
<sup><xref rid="rep-ref-5919-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p><p>Notably, this point does not affect the validity of any conclusions reached in the manuscript. However, it may significantly mislead the reader about the larger context of CaMKII in synaptic plasticity. Recently, we have shown that CaMKII T286 phosphorylation is required not only for LTP, but also for LTD
<sup><xref rid="rep-ref-5919-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Prior to this, other recent evidence had already suggested a more prolonged T286 phosphorylation after LTD than after LTP
<sup><xref rid="rep-ref-5919-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>
<sup><xref rid="rep-ref-5919-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>
<sup><xref rid="rep-ref-5919-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> (for review see&#x000a0;Coultrap &#x00026; Bayer, 2012
<sup><xref rid="rep-ref-5919-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>). If T286 phosphorylation would induce the most effective CaMKII binding to GluN2B (as stated), binding would be expected to be more extensive after LTD compared to LTP. However, this does not appear to be the case
<sup><xref rid="rep-ref-5919-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, and the CaMKII/GluN2B interaction contributes exclusively to the CaMKII functions in LTP but not in LTD
<sup><xref rid="rep-ref-5919-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p><p>I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="rep-ref-5919-1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Halt</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Dallpiazza</surname><given-names>RF</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Stein</surname><given-names>IS</given-names></name><name><surname>Qian</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Juntti</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Wojcik</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Brose</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Silva</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Hell</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name></person-group>:

The current findings extend those of the authors in
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22234183">Halt
<italic>et al</italic>. (2012)</ext-link> where spaced training over 6 days in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) revealed no deficits in spatial learning but did find significant deficits in consolidation of long-term memory probed several days after training in theses CaMKII binding-deficient GluN2B knock-in mice.</p><p>Interestingly, here, using a more intense and demanding one day, massed training version of the MWM, the authors now detect modest deficits in these GluN2B knock-in mice, not only in memory probed one day after training, but also in spatial learning measured on the day of training. However, other single day training spatial/contextual learning and memory tests, that are both more aversive but less spatially challenging (contextual fear conditioning) and less aversive but more spatially challenging (Barnes maze), did not reveal any difference in performance between WT and GluN2B knock-in mice. Thus, an important conclusion of this study is that increased postsynaptic targeting of CaMKII and the increased level of LTP (~50%; see Halt et al.) that are achieved through CaMKII binding to GluN2B are only required for spatial learning when the task is both fairly demanding and at least moderately aversive. These findings should give the field a heightened appreciation that highly-compartmentalized regulation of signaling pathways by postsynaptic&#x000a0;protein-protein scaffolding interactions, such as achieved through CaMKII binding to GluN2B during LTP-induction, may not be absolutely essential for spatial learning and memory in general but may have evolved to allow animals to specifically sustain optimal spatial learning and memory capabilities even under demanding and stressful circumstances.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is very well written and the data are rigorously analyzed and presented clearly.</p><p>I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.</p></body></sub-article></article>
