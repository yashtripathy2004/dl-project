Although associated bacterial communities might be important for many aspects of <italic>Drosophila</italic> biology, knowledge about their diversity, composition, and factors shaping them is limited. We used 454-based sequencing of a variable region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene to characterize the bacterial communities associated with wild and laboratory <italic>Drosophila</italic> isolates. In order to specifically investigate effects of food source and host species on bacterial communities, we analyzed samples from wild <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> collected from a variety of natural substrates, as well as from adults and larvae of nine laboratory-reared <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. We find no evidence for host species effects in lab-reared flies; instead, lab of origin and stochastic effects, which could influence studies of <italic>Drosophila</italic> phenotypes, are pronounced. In contrast, the natural <italic>Drosophila</italic>&#x02013;associated microbiota appears to be predominantly shaped by food substrate with an additional but smaller effect of host species identity. We identify a core member of this natural microbiota that belongs to the genus <italic>Gluconobacter</italic> and is common to all wild-caught flies in this study, but absent from the laboratory. This makes it a strong candidate for being part of what could be a natural <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> core microbiome. Furthermore, we were able to identify candidate pathogens in natural fly isolates.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by a DFG Forschungsstipedium to FS (STA 1154/1-1).

Indirect evidence for competition for ecological niches in the host comes from Staubach <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0070749-Staubach1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> who found that the lack of the glycosyltransferase B4galnt2 in mice leads to the replacement of bacterial taxa by closely related taxa. Bakula <xref rid="pone.0070749-Bakula1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> showed that <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> persists in <italic>Drosophila</italic> only when monoxenic and is quickly replaced by other bacteria upon exposure suggesting that there is competition between bacteria to colonize the fly. Ryu <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0070749-Ryu1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> demonstrated that suppressing the caudal gene by RNAi in <italic>Drosophila</italic> leads to replacement of an <italic>Acetobacter</italic> species by a <italic>Gluconobacter</italic> species followed by strong pathological consequences. These examples indicate that there is interaction and competition for ecological niches along the continuum of hosts and microbes. Thus, a thorough understanding of host-microbe interactions also requires comprehensive knowledge of host associated bacterial communities and the factors shaping them.</p><p>These factors can roughly be grouped into two categories. The first category includes biotic and abiotic environmental factors the host and its associated microbes are exposed to (e.g. diet). The second category includes factors that are determined by host genetics. The relative importance of these factors in shaping human associated microbial communities is a matter of recent debate <xref rid="pone.0070749-Arumugam1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070749-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. One approach to disentangle these effects is by studying the relationship of host genetic divergence, diet, and divergence of microbial communities. A correlation of genetic divergence between a set of host taxa and the divergence of their associated microbial communities would suggest that genetic effects play a role in shaping these communities. On the other hand, a correlation of microbial community composition with diet would suggest an effect of environmental factors. This approach has been applied to a variety of mammals <xref rid="pone.0070749-Ley1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070749-Muegge1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, but it has proven difficult in mammals to control for diet and other environmental factors across host taxa. Hence, it is not yet clear, which factors are the strongest determinants of microbiota composition.</p><p>In contrast to the complex microbial communities associated with mammals like humans and mice, which are estimated to consist of hundreds or even thousands of taxa <xref rid="pone.0070749-Staubach1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070749-Yatsunenko1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, some studies suggest that only a handful of bacterial species dominate the microbial communities of invertebrates <xref rid="pone.0070749-Fraune1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070749-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. This has turned a spotlight on <italic>Drosophila</italic> to serve as a simpler model for understanding the complex interactions of hosts and their associated microbes <xref rid="pone.0070749-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070749-Erkosar1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune system is reasonably well understood <xref rid="pone.0070749-Lemaitre1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and the tractability of <italic>Drosophila</italic> has helped to identify genes involved in specific interactions between host and microbes. This includes genes underlying avoidance behavior towards harmful bacteria <xref rid="pone.0070749-Stensmyr1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and immune defense <xref rid="pone.0070749-Lazzaro1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> as well as interactions with commensals <xref rid="pone.0070749-Lhocine1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and beneficial bacteria that prevent pathogens from colonizing the host <xref rid="pone.0070749-Ryu1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> or promote its growth <xref rid="pone.0070749-Shin1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070749-Storelli1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>As a first step in understanding the diversity of bacterial communities associated with <italic>Drosophila</italic> it is important to investigate flies under natural conditions. Most studies conducted to date focused on more specific interactions or those found in the lab <xref rid="pone.0070749-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070749-Ren1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, while few studies described the natural diversity of fly associated bacterial communities. Cox and Gilmore <xref rid="pone.0070749-Cox1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> included natural fly isolates and combined culture and culture-independent methods to characterize fly associated microbial communities. Corby-Harris <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0070749-CorbyHarris1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> focused their study on the diversity of microbial communities along latitudinal clines. Chandler <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0070749-Chandler1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> conducted the most comprehensive analysis of bacteria associated with <italic>Drosophila</italic> by sampling a range of drosophilid flies from their natural food substrates. However, these studies were limited by either throughput or dependence on cultivation <xref rid="pone.0070749-Barata1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Although Chandler <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0070749-Chandler1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> sampled flies from different natural substrates, their sampling scheme did not allow to directly disentangle host species and diet effects on the natural microbiota because this requires replicated, pairwise sampling of at least two host species from the identical substrate.</p><p>In order to understand bacterial communities associated with <italic>Drosophila</italic> and the factors shaping their diversity, we investigated the relative effects of food substrate and fly species. Accordingly, we analyzed <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> collected in pairs from different natural food sources, as well as under controlled lab conditions. Furthermore, we assessed the communities of nine lab-reared <italic>Drosophila</italic> species and their larvae to evaluate the influence of host genetic background on a broad scale. These species were selected to span the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genus and match the 12 species sequenced by Clark <italic>et al.</italic>

Three types of fly isolates were used in our study. The samples are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0070749-t001">Table 1</xref>. First, species-pairs of wild-caught <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> samples were collected from different substrates (oranges, strawberries, apples, peaches, compost) at multiple locations on the East and West Coast of the USA. Within each sample pair, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> individuals were collected at the same location, time, and substrate (mostly by aspiration of individual flies from the same fruit), thereby controlling for environmental variables to the extent possible in the field. This allowed us to study the effects of both, substrate and host species on the composition of bacterial communities independently of each other. Second, we included isofemale, wild-derived strains of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> that were reared in the Petrov lab for &#x0223c;3 years after collection. Third, a variety of <italic>Drosophila</italic> species from the UCSD Stock Center was chosen to complement the analysis. We primarily focused on adults, but also studied bacterial communities in larvae of the lab-reared strains. We analyzed a total of &#x0223c;340,000 sequences that matched our quality criteria (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Materials and Methods</xref>). &#x0223c;130,000 sequences matched the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> 16S rRNA gene and were excluded from the analysis. For Petrov lab <italic>D. simulans</italic> sample 6, removal of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> sequences led to a very low number of remaining sequences (18 sequences). Therefore, we excluded this sample from further analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0070749.s002">Table S1</xref> lists the total number of sequences and the proportion of

Our species richness estimates from wild-caught flies are more than twice as high on average (43 vs 19, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) if we exclude all OTUs that contain fewer than 10 sequences from our data as in Wong <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0070749-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Bacterial diversity, as measured by Shannon's diversity index, is also significantly higher in wild-caught flies (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) from this study.

This is not significantly different from the richness estimates of the other studies on wild-caught flies, implying that different sequencing depths are responsible for the different species richness estimates.

In order to disentangle environmental from host species effects, we collected and compared sample pairs of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> from the same natural substrates. We extended this approach by analyzing these two species under controlled laboratory conditions. Finally, in order to generalize our results, we also analyzed a set of host species spanning the <italic>Drosophila</italic> phylogeny. A correlation between genetic distance of different fly species and the dissimilarity of their bacterial communities under controlled conditions would be an indication that genetic differences between host species could play a role in shaping fly bacterial communities. Therefore, we extracted bacterial DNA from whole flies by carrying out extensive tissue homogenization. The bacterial load on the fly surface is known to be &#x0223c;10 times lower than the interior load <xref rid="pone.0070749-Ren1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Therefore, the influence of external bacteria on the total community composition is expected to be rather minor. Additionally, our focus on the total bacteria associated with the whole fly, and not only the intestinal tract, was motivated by the belief that bacteria associated with fly surfaces might play important roles in shaping the fly environment. This is supported by Ren <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0070749-Ren1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> who found acetic acid bacteria accumulating in bristled areas on the fly surface, likely forming biofilms and by Barata <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0070749-Barata1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> who demonstrated that damaged grapes do not acquire acetic acid bacteria when insects, particularly <italic>Drosophila</italic>, are physically excluded. These acetic acid bacteria could very well be transported on the fly surface. Note that even though we aspirated flies from individual fruit and attempted to associate bacterial communities with the substrate, we likely sampled bacterial communities that the fly has acquired during its life span. This includes bacteria from the particular fruit from which it was sampled, but could also include bacteria potentially from prior locations.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Factors shaping natural fly associated communities</title><p>We determined that substrate or a strongly correlated variable is the most important factor shaping bacterial communities in wild-caught flies. Diet has been previously suggested as a major determinant of bacterial community composition in mammals <xref rid="pone.0070749-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070749-Ley1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070749-Ravussin1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and flies <xref rid="pone.0070749-Chandler1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and our results agree with these findings. The most distinct bacterial communities were associated with flies collected from oranges. Oranges contain citric acid and might have a lower pH than other substrates. Furthermore, orange peel contains essential oils that have bactericidal properties that might influence the bacterial community composition <xref rid="pone.0070749-Dabbah1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Although the substrate appears to be a plausible factor shaping the communities here, we cannot disentangle its effects from seasonal effects (e.g. temperature, humidity). This is because we collected flies from different substrates at different times of the year when the respective fruit were ripe.</p><p>We carefully sampled <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> across different sites and substrates in nature which allowed us to disentangle environmental effects from host species effects on microbial community composition. We found evidence that host fly species identity (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic> vs. <italic>D. simulans</italic>) detectably influences the associated microbial communities, but that the effect is subtle. Although our power comparing lab-reared <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> might be lower because of smaller sample size and restriction to fewer sequences, mainly due to high <italic>Wolbachia</italic> prevalence in some lab-reared samples, it is intriguing that this host species effect is detectable only in the wild and could not be detected in lab-reared flies. Moreover, while we detected differences between two closely related sister species in the wild, we could not detect any differences for nine substantially more divergent <italic>Drosophila</italic> species in the lab. We found no correspondence of distances between bacterial communities and genetic distances between nine lab-reared fly species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0070749.s003">Table S2</xref>), unlike Ochman <italic>et al.</italic>

Interestingly, bacteria from different genera, but with similar metabolic properties, dominate the communities of wild-caught, Petrov lab, and UCSD Stock Center flies. <italic>Gluconobacter</italic> species are the most prevalent bacteria in wild-caught flies in our study.

<xref rid="pone.0070749-Chandler1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> who find a smaller fraction of <italic>Gluconobacter</italic> sequences. More than 90% of all <italic>Gluconobacter</italic> sequences in our study can be grouped into a single OTU that is common in all wild-caught flies. In contrast, <italic>Gluconobacter</italic> is almost absent from the lab strains. Thus, this OTU is a strong candidate for being a major member of a core microbiome that is shared among and specific to wild-caught <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic>. <italic>Gluconobacter</italic> belongs to the same family (Acetobacteraceae) as <italic>Acetobacter</italic>, which is also common in wild-caught flies with the exception of flies from oranges that carry less <italic>Acetobacter. Acetobacter</italic> is also the most prevalent genus in flies from the UCSD Stock Center and has very similar metabolic capabilities. Both genera, <italic>Gluconobacter</italic> and <italic>Acetobacter</italic>, oxidize sugars and alcohol to acetic acid, and tolerate low pH as well as high ethanol concentrations <xref rid="pone.0070749-Deppenmeier1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.

<xref rid="pone.0070749-Crotti1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> which is at high prevalence in Petrov lab flies, tolerates low pH and high ethanol concentrations as well, but instead oxidize sugars to lactic acid <xref rid="pone.0070749-DeVos1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The high prevalence of bacteria with similar metabolic capabilities, tolerance of low pH, and high ethanol concentrations strongly suggests that there is environmental selection for these bacterial groups. Rotting fruit, the most important natural substrate for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> in our study, contain high amounts of sugar and are known to be colonized by a variety of ethanol producing yeasts <xref rid="pone.0070749-Rao1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Yeasts can produce high alcohol concentrations, thereby generating a nutrient rich environment for acetic acid or lactic acid producing bacteria (Acetobacteraceae and Lactobacillaceae), while inhibiting the growth of those less tolerant to alcohol. The production of these acids selects for acid tolerant microorganisms including the microorganisms that produced the acids in the first place. This suggests that environmental selection <xref rid="pone.0070749-Vellend1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> is an important factor for the observed prevalence of these bacteria.</p><p>Interestingly bacteria of the genus <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, which have been associated with effects on <italic>Drosophila</italic> growth <xref rid="pone.0070749-Storelli1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and even assortative mating <xref rid="pone.0070749-Sharon1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, are prevalent only in the lab in our study. Sixty percent of all sequences from Petrov lab flies, and 19% of all sequences obtained from UCSD Stock Center flies are <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>. In most wild-caught samples <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> represented less than 1% of all sequences. This finding is corroborated by results from Chandler <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0070749-Chandler1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, who find an increase of the proportion of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species in lab-reared flies. Thus, while studying the effects of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> on drosophilids in the laboratory is useful as a general model for insect-microbe interactions, its relevance to <italic>Drosophila</italic> in nature may be limited.</p><p>In contrast to Chandler <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0070749-Chandler1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, who found that Enterobacteriaceae from group Orbus are highly prevalent in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, these bacteria are absent or at very low frequency in our samples (not amongst the best BLAST hits for any of the 100 most abundant OTUs in our data set). Although two lower abundant OTUs (OTU 49 and OTU 221) have Orbus sequences among the top 50 BLAST hits, the sequences from <xref rid="pone.0070749-Chandler1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> are not amongst these hits. We can only speculate about the reasons for this difference here. One possibility might be an epidemic of Orbus group bacteria in 2007 and 2008, when Chandler <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0070749-Chandler1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> collected their samples.</p><p>Given the strong effect of food substrates that we observed in wild <italic>Drosophila</italic>, similar effects might play a role in lab-reared flies. Differences in the provided food substrates between laboratories might therefore lead to differences in communities. For example, we provide our flies with a corn meal molasses diet, whereas the Stock Center uses sugar instead of molasses. In addition, our food contains Tegosept(r) to reduce microbial growth, while this ingredient is only optional at UCSD. Intriguingly, Chandler <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0070749-Chandler1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> found that fly-associated bacterial communities differed between labs at UC Davis despite using the same food from the same kitchen, suggesting that other factors are involved as well.

A potential role of stochastic drift processes and priority effects is supported by the notion that the occurrence of the two major <italic>Acetobacter</italic> OTUs (OTU 26 and 38) in the UCSD Stock Center flies is strongly antagonistic. This is in accordance with a model in which one of the OTUs quickly occupies an ecological niche and excludes its ecologically similar, close relative.</p><p>Bacterial communities of lab-reared flies are highly variable in diversity and composition within and between laboratories in this study.

This makes it more difficult to detect genetic variation underlying phenotypic traits and reduces reproducibility between laboratories. The presence of a certain microbiota might also lead to unwanted results in genetic trait mapping: Genetic variation that is attributed to directly underlie a phenotypic trait might indeed interact with microbes that influence this trait instead, thus influencing the trait only indirectly. Monitoring of microbial communities during experiments in which phenotypes are measured could be a means to approach these difficulties.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Species richness of lab-reared and wild-caught <italic>Drosophila</italic> associated bacterial communities</title><p>Although diversity varies strongly across different samples from lab-reared flies, their bacterial communities are on average less diverse than those of wild-caught flies.

Despite appreciable effort, we did not find evidence for host species effects on the bacterial communities under controlled laboratory conditions. Instead, laboratory of origin and stochastic effects on microbial communities are pronounced in the laboratory. This suggests that host genetic effects, as represented by genetic differences between the fly species in this study, might be rather small or absent in the lab, while there is potential for such effects under natural conditions. Furthermore, we find that acetic acid producing bacteria (Acetobacteracea) are ubiquitous symbionts of <italic>Drosophila</italic> in nature. Intriguingly, it has been shown both that <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> promotes dispersal and establishment of these bacteria <xref rid="pone.0070749-Barata1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and that the presence of acetic acid bacteria can have beneficial effects on <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larval growth and development time <xref rid="pone.0070749-Shin1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.

DNA extraction was performed using the Qiagen QIAamp DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol with the following modifications: Flies/larvae were incubated in buffer ATL containing proteinase K at 56&#x000b0;C for 30 min to soften and predigest the exoskeleton. Digestion was then interrupted by 3 minutes of bead beating on a BioSpec Mini Bead Beater 96 with glass beads 0.1 mm, 0.5 mm, and 1 mm in size (BioSpec, Bartlesville, OK), followed by another 30 min of incubation at 56&#x000b0;C. After addition of lysis buffer AL samples were incubated 30 min at 70&#x000b0;C and 10 min at 95&#x000b0;C. The remaining extraction procedure was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Extraction controls were run in parallel with all samples to monitor contamination. Broad range primers (27F and 338R) were fused to identification tags and the 454 sequencing primers to amplify a fragment spanning the variable regions V1 and V2 of the bacterial ribosomal 16S rRNA gene. The primer sequences are (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-CTATGCGCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTC<underline>AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG</underline>-3&#x02032;</named-content>) and reverse (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-CGTATCGCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGXXXXXXXXXXCA<underline>TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT</underline>-3&#x02032;</named-content>). The Xs are a placeholder for identification tags (Multiplex Identifiers, MIDs); a different tag was used for each amplification reaction. Primers 27F and 338R are underlined. DNA was amplified using Phusion&#x000ae; Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) and the following cycling conditions: 30 sec at 98&#x000b0;C; 35 cycles of 9 sec at 98&#x000b0;C, 30 sec at 55&#x000b0;C, and 30 sec at 72&#x000b0;C; final extension for 10 min at 72&#x000b0;C). In order to reduce PCR bias, amplification reactions were performed in duplicate and pooled. In order to reduce the number of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> amplicons, PCR products were restriction digested with 2 &#x000b5;l FastDigest&#x000ae; BstZ17 (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD) at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min. BstZ17 was selected to specifically cut <italic>Wolbachia</italic> sequences close to the middle of the amplified region. Reaction products were run on an agarose gel, extracted using the Qiagen MinElute Gel Extraction Kit, and quantified with the Quant-iT&#x02122; dsDNA BR Assay Kit on a NanoDrop 3300 Fluorometer. Equimolar amounts of purified PCR product from each sample were pooled and further purified using Ampure Beads (Agencourt). The pool was run on an Agilent Bioanalyzer prior to emulsion PCR for final quantification. Resulting PCR products were run on a 454 sequencer using Titanium Chemistry. A set of samples was extracted using a FastPrep FP120 bead beater (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA). These samples include <italic>D. erecta</italic>, <italic>D. yakuba</italic>, <italic>D. sechellia</italic> from the UCSD Stock Center, and wild-caught samples collected in Johnston, RI. These samples were sequenced twice, with and without the BstZ17 digest. Relative abundance of bacterial taxa correlated strongly between the two procedures for these samples after removal of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> reads (mean r<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.94). Therefore, we pooled the sequencing reads obtained with and without the digest to get a higher sequencing depth per sample.</p><p>Amplicons from samples with a high <italic>Wolbachia</italic> load were often so effectively digested that the final DNA yield was too small for library preparation. In order to have enough PCR-product for library construction, we shortened digestion time for amplicons from these samples to 5 minutes, resulting in an incomplete digest. Predictably, these samples yielded a high percentage of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> sequences after the incomplete digest.</p><p>We verified the specificity of the BstZ17 for cutting <italic>Wolbachia</italic> sequences by an <italic>in silico</italic> search for restriction sites in our sequences from undigested samples, all sequences from Chandler <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0070749-Chandler1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, and all bacterial sequences in the SILVA data base. A very small fraction of non-<italic>Wolbachia</italic> sequences would have been cut in our sequence set from undigested samples (27 out of 23423) and the data from Chandler <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0070749-Chandler1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> (18 out of 3243, mainly confined to a single sample). The majority of these sequences were classified as Rhizobiales. <italic>In silico</italic> search for the BstZ17 restriction site in sequences from the SILVA database revealed that the sequences that would have been cut by the restriction enzyme fall mainly into the orders of Rhizobiales, Myxococcales, and a non-<italic>Wolbachia</italic> Rickettsiales. Although these orders have either not been reported to be associated with <italic>Drosophila</italic> or occur only at very low numbers, the pretreatment with BstZ17 of most of our samples might have led to underestimation of their abundance in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s5c"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The MOTHUR v1.23.1 <xref rid="pone.0070749-Schloss1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> software was used for analysis. We used the trim.seqs command to remove primer and MID tags and quality filter our sequences according to the following requirements: Minimum average quality of 35 in each 50 bp window, minimum length of 260 bp, homopolymers no longer than 8 bp. Only sequences matching the MIDs and the bacterial primers perfectly were kept. Passing sequences were filtered for sequencing errors using the pre.cluster command. Sequences were then screened for chimeras using UCHIME <xref rid="pone.0070749-Edgar1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref> as implemented in MOTHUR with standard settings separately for each sample. 2% of all sequences were identified as chimeric and discarded. The remaining sequences were aligned to the SILVA reference database <xref rid="pone.0070749-Pruesse1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> using the MOTHUR implemented kmer algorithm with standard settings. Sequences not aligning in the expected region were removed using the screen.seqs command. Sequences were classified into bacterial taxa with the classify.seqs command using the SILVA reference database and taxonomy with default settings. Sequences classified as <italic>Wolbachia</italic> were removed from further analysis. Grouping of sequences into OTUs was done using the MOTHUR implemented average neighbor algorithm. Inverted Simpson and Shannon diversity indices were generated with the collect.single command. Rarefaction sampling was performed with the rarefaction.single command. The sequence with the smallest distance to all other sequences in each OTU was picked with the get.oturep command using the weighted option and classified with the classify.otu command using the SILVA reference database and taxonomy. Representative sequences of the 100 most common OTUs were also searched in the nr/nt database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (ncbi) using megablast with default settings via the web server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>). Taxonomy information from the BLAST results was compared to the classification using the SILVA database. PCoA of Jaccard distances was performed applying the pcoa command on a Jaccard distance matrix generated with the dist.shared command. Because Jaccard distance is based on presence and absence of OTUs, it is sensitive to information from low abundance OTUs, even in the presence of other more abundant OTUs. In an abundance-based distance measure this information would likely be swamped by few extremely common OTUs. These considerations are particularly relevant to our study where a handful of bacterial families dominate the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070749-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Jaccard distances are also less prone to be affected by biased abundance measurements that can result from amplification biases during PCR amplification of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The downside of the sensitivity of Jaccard distances to low abundance OTUs is that samples with a higher number of bacterial sequence reads can be biased towards detecting more low abundance OTUs which inflates Jaccard distance. Therefore the number of sequences per sample was <italic>in silico</italic> capped to have the same number of sequences per sample before calculation of Jaccard distances. The caps were 912 sequences per sample for the PCoA of wild-caught flies and 116 sequences per sample for the PCoA including all samples.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Data Availability</title><p>The raw data can be found on MG-RAST <xref rid="pone.0070749-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> servers using the following IDs : 4523254.3, 4523281.3, 4523255.3, 4523282.3, 4523256.3, 4523283.3, 4523270.3, 4523297.3, 4523252.3, 4523279.3, 4523257.3, 4523284.3, 4523253.3, 4523280.3, 4523258.3, 4523260.3, 4523262.3, 4523264.3, 4523266.3, 4523268.3, 4523285.3, 4523287.3, 4523289.3, 4523291.3, 4523293.3, 4523295.3, 4523259.3, 4523261.3, 4523263.3, 4523265.3, 4523267.3, 4523269.3, 4523286.3, 4523288.3, 4523290.3, 4523292.3, 4523294.3, 4523296.3, 4523271.3, 4523300.3, 4523298.3, 4523304.3, 4523250.3, 4523275.3, 4523277.3, 4523302.3, 4523273.3, 4523272.3, 4523301.3, 4523299.3, 4523305.3, 4523251.3, 4523276.3, 4523278.3, 4523303.3, 4523274.3 and on datadryad.org under doi:10.5061/dryad.5q1sb.
