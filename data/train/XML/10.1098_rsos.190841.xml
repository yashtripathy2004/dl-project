Yet, it is often unclear whether the extent and direction of plastic changes are restricted by an individual's ontogeny. Many species of cichlid fishes go through ontogenetic changes in visual sensitivity, from short to long wavelengths, by switching expression of cone opsin genes crucial for colour vision. During this progression, individuals often exhibit phenotypic plasticity to the ambient light conditions. However, it is commonly assumed that once an adult visual phenotype is reached, reverting to an earlier ontogenetic state with higher sensitivity at shorter wavelengths is not common. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate that four-month-old Midas cichlid fish (<italic>Amphilophus astorquii</italic>) show plasticity in single cone opsin expression after experiencing drastic changes in light conditions. Resulting shifts of visual sensitivity occurred presumably in an adaptive direction&#x02014;towards shorter or longer wavelengths when exposed to short- or long-wavelength light, respectively. Single cone opsin expression changed within only a few days and went through a transitional phase of co-expression. When the environment was experimentally enriched in long-wavelength light, the corresponding change occurred gradually along a dorsoventral gradient within the retina. This plasticity allowed individuals to revert earlier ontogenetic changes and return to a more juvenile visual phenotype demonstrating previously unrecognized insights into temporal and spatial dynamics of phenotypic plasticity of the visual system in response to ambient light.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>opsin</kwd><kwd>Midas cichlid</kwd><kwd>amphilophus</kwd><kwd>Nicaragua</kwd><kwd>fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization</kwd><kwd>visual system</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>293700-GenAdap</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Young Scholar Fund, University of Konstanz</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>83944318</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>July, 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Phenotypic plasticity, the ability to respond to environmental variation [<xref rid="RSOS190841C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], is ubiquitous in nature but varies substantially among species. Particularly, adaptive phenotypic plasticity is an important mechanism to approximate local fitness optima [<xref rid="RSOS190841C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS190841C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], also in adjusting the visual system to varying light conditions [<xref rid="RSOS190841C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSOS190841C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In vertebrate retinas, light absorption is achieved by visual pigments consisting of an opsin protein and a chromophore [<xref rid="RSOS190841C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A visual pigment's wavelength of maximum sensitivity is determined by the type of chromophore and the structure of the opsin protein [<xref rid="RSOS190841C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Cichlid fishes are an emerging model system in visual ecology since they have, as several other teleosts [<xref rid="RSOS190841C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], a rich set of seven cone opsins (responsible for colour vision) compared with humans who only have three. In particular, cichlids have two types of cone cells, single and double cones, which express short (<italic>sws1</italic>, <italic>sws2b</italic>, <italic>sws2a</italic>) and medium- to long-wavelength-sensitive opsins (<italic>rh2b</italic>, <italic>rh2a&#x003b2;</italic>, <italic>rh2a&#x003b1;</italic>, <italic>lws</italic>), respectively [<xref rid="RSOS190841C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, opsin expression patterns are highly variable among species, suggesting that differences in colour vision evolve rapidly [<xref rid="RSOS190841C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS190841C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Accordingly, adaptive evolution and diversification of cichlids' visual systems occur mostly by expressing different subsets of cone opsins [<xref rid="RSOS190841C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSOS190841C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which might have been facilitated by phenotypic plasticity of opsin expression patterns.</p><p>During ontogeny, many cichlid species shift opsin expression from short- to long-wavelength sensitivity [<xref rid="RSOS190841C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Phenotypic plasticity in opsin expression seems to be rather common during this ontogenetic progression but appears to be restricted once the adult visual phenotype has been reached [<xref rid="RSOS190841C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS190841C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but see [<xref rid="RSOS190841C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS190841C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. <italic>Amphilophus astorquii</italic>, our study species, shows a paedomorphic visual phenotype, which might allow this species to maintain some degree of plasticity into adulthood, at least in the same direction as the ontogenetic progression (towards longer wavelengths) [<xref rid="RSOS190841C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Yet, it remains unclear to what extent phenotypic plasticity of opsin expression can override typical ontogenetic changes in the long term and whether cone opsin expression patterns can also be reverted to a previous ontogenetic state.</p><p>Hence, <italic>A. astorquii</italic> provides an excellent system to investigate whether ontogenetic change constrains extent or direction of phenotypic plasticity of opsin expression. In this study, we found that (i) phenotypic plasticity occurs rapidly within a few days, (ii) plasticity can appear in the same but also the opposite direction of the ontogenetic progression in opsin expression and (iii) plastic changes seem to be produced by spatial modifications of opsin expression along the retina's dorsoventral axis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Material and Methods</title><p>Second-generation laboratory-bred descendants of wild-caught <italic>A. astorquii</italic> were reared under light at the short (blue, 450 nm) or long (red, 630 nm) extremes of the visible light spectrum [<xref rid="RSOS190841C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. After hatching, siblings were randomly assigned to one of the two light treatments. At an age of four months&#x02014;118 days post-hatching (dph)&#x02014;fish in each treatment were randomly divided into two groups and were either retained in the same treatment or were exchanged between the treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS190841F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>a</italic>). From this point onwards for 14 days, one individual from the exchange groups (blue-to-red, red-to-blue) was collected every day to monitor changes in cone opsin expression. At the beginning and the end of the experimental period, retinas were collected from some individuals of the blue and red treatments (<italic>n</italic> = 6/light treatment). Fish were sacrificed with an overdose of MS-222 (400 mg l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and subsequent cervical dislocation. One retina per individual was stored in RNAlater for qPCR and one was fixed (4% paraformaldehyde in PBS) for fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH). Total RNA was extracted (RNeasy Mini Kit; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and 500 ng were reverse transcribed (GoScript<sup>&#x02122;</sup> Reverse Transcription System; Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). Expression levels of opsin genes were based on qPCR data of two technical replicates and mean threshold cycle (Ct) values were used for subsequent analysis. Before and after the 14-day experimental period, expression of cone opsins was calculated proportionally to overall cone opsin expression (incorporating qPCR efficiencies) as previously described [<xref rid="RSOS190841C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS190841C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For fish reared under either blue or red light for 118 and 132 days, we tested whether treatment or age has an effect on cone opsin expression by using a nonparametric equivalent to a two-way ANOVA, the Scheirer&#x02013;Ray&#x02013;Hare test [<xref rid="RSOS190841C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. All linear regression models were tested for heteroscedasticity with Breusch&#x02013;Pagan tests [<xref rid="RSOS190841C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. During the 14-day experimental period, proportional expression was separately calculated for the predominantly expressed opsins in single (<italic>sws2b</italic>, <italic>sws2a</italic>) and double cones (<italic>rh2a&#x003b2;</italic>, <italic>lws</italic>). Because <italic>rh2a&#x003b1;</italic> is not expressed in Midas cichlids [<xref rid="RSOS190841C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS190841C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], it was excluded from this study. It should be noted that only one individual was analysed for each time point in the exchange treatments, which precludes statistical analyses of the observed changes in cone opsin expression.

For quantifying spatial patterns of opsin expression, retinas were overlaid with an 8 &#x000d7; 8 grid and for each segment, cone cells within a defined square (side lengths: 100 &#x000b5;m) were counted.

Besides, the interaction term between treatment and age was significant for <italic>rh2a&#x003b2;</italic> (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001). These results imply that ambient light can induce and maintain differential opsin expression to an age of at least four months. Since the single cone opsin <italic>sws1</italic> was not substantially expressed in either of the two treatments and expression of the double cone opsin <italic>rh2b</italic> decreased to zero in the blue treatment during the 14-day experimental period (which precluded distinguishing between normal ontogenetic changes and plasticity induced by the light treatments), those two opsins were omitted from further analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS190841F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>a</italic>).</p><p>Single cone opsin expression patterns (<italic>sws2b</italic> and <italic>sws2a</italic>) could be rapidly altered at an age of four months, in the same direction as the typical ontogenetic progression (blue-to-red), but could also be reverted to an earlier developmental stage (red-to-blue; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS190841F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>c</italic>).

At the beginning of the treatment switch, blue-to-red fish expressed <italic>sws2b</italic> and <italic>sws2a</italic> without any obvious gradient along the dorsoventral axis and this pattern was maintained until 10 days after switching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS190841F2">figure&#x000a0;2</xref><italic>a</italic>), afterwards only <italic>sws2a</italic> was expressed (similar to qPCR results; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS190841F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>c</italic>).

Remarkably, single cone opsin expression patterns could even be reverted to resemble a more juvenile phenotype when exposed to short-wavelength light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS190841F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>d</italic>).</p><p>Phenotypic plasticity of cone opsin expression in adult individuals has been shown only in a few teleost species, including <italic>A. astorquii</italic> [<xref rid="RSOS190841C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS190841C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS190841C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, it was not known whether plasticity was constrained by the ontogenetic progression from short- to long-wavelength sensitivity, as suggested by previous findings [<xref rid="RSOS190841C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Our results demonstrate that Midas cichlids are indeed able to revert their visual phenotype to reflect a previous ontogenetic state when moved from red to blue light and shifts seemed to occur even faster than in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS190841F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>c</italic>). Hence, changes were not merely produced in the same direction as the ontogenetic progression but the expression of single cone opsins could be freely adjusted to different light conditions, even at an age of four months. Previously, we have shown that individuals of this species can even exhibit phenotypic plasticity of cone opsins at an age of six months [<xref rid="RSOS190841C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].

Crater lake Apoyo, the habitat of <italic>A. astorquii</italic>, is very deep [<xref rid="RSOS190841C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and water clarity changes seasonally, as in other Nicaraguan crater lakes [<xref rid="RSOS190841C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Hence, the ability to adjust opsin expression appears to be important for the visual ecology of these fish and might be selectively advantageous in their natural environment.</p><p>Shifts in single cone opsin expression were initiated in the ventral retina and then spread dorsally over the course of a few days in the red-to-blue treatment. By contrast, no such gradient was evident in the blue-to-red treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS190841F2">figure&#x000a0;2</xref>). Dorsoventral gradients in opsin expression are widespread across vertebrates and are assumed to be adaptive as they improve visual tasks associated with different regions of the retina [<xref rid="RSOS190841C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and can also be induced when the light of varying spectral composition reaches different parts of the retina [<xref rid="RSOS190841C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS190841C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It would be highly interesting to further explore whether the same molecular mechanisms underlie such opsin expression gradients produced either by adaptive evolution or by phenotypic plasticity.</p><p>One question that remains is whether the observed changes in cone opsin expression are indeed adaptive. Commonly, it is assumed that cone opsin expression aims to maximize quantum catch and we have recently shown that several species of cichlid fishes indeed shifted opsin expression according to the light conditions during adaptive evolution in novel environments [<xref rid="RSOS190841C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS190841C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. But, our models based on the light conditions in our treatments show that <italic>sws2a</italic> actually captures more light than <italic>sws2b</italic> in the blue treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS190841F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>b</italic>). Hence, the observed shifts in single cone expression cannot be explained by an increased quantum catch of single cone opsins alone but visual tasks such as colour differentiation or contrast detection might play a crucial role. Contrarily, the quantum catch of double cone opsins (<italic>rh2a&#x003b2;</italic> and <italic>lws</italic>) strongly differs between treatments, but gene expression was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS190841F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref>). The observation that single cone opsin expression remained highly variable across individuals until day 10 in the blue-to-red treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS190841F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>c</italic>) could, thus, be due to the fact that quantum catch of both <italic>sws2</italic> paralogs is low, but equal in the red light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS190841F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>b</italic>). This might inhibit a more rapid alteration of single cone opsin expression as seen in the red-to-blue treatment. However, at this point, it is not clear how the observed changes affect the perception of different colours and behavioural data will be needed to clarify the advantage of varying visual phenotypes in different light environments and the maintained capacity to alter them throughout ontogeny.</p><p>The rapid changes in opsin expression seen here cannot be explained by apoptosis and replacement of photoreceptors nor by the addition of novel photoreceptors due to overall eye growth since these mechanisms would take a longer time. Rather, a switch in expressed single cone opsins must have occurred within the existing photoreceptors, as was previously described during the development of salmon [<xref rid="RSOS190841C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The mechanism presented by Cheng &#x00026; Flamarique implies a transitional phase with co-expression of two opsins in the same photoreceptor. Indeed, we observed co-expression of <italic>sws2a</italic> and <italic>sws2b</italic> during our exchange experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS190841F2">figure&#x000a0;2</xref>), providing strong evidence that rapid adjustment of <italic>A. astorquii's</italic> visual system to novel light conditions occurred via replacement of the expressed opsins within single cone cells.</p><p>We provide experimental evidence that cichlid fish from the same brood maintain distinct cone opsin expression patterns until an age of at least four months when reared under different light conditions. Further, at that age, individuals can rapidly adjust colour vision by changing expression levels of single cone opsin genes when switched between these light treatments. This switch occurs via a dorsoventral gradient in one case and is characterized by a transitional phase of co-expression. Most interestingly, we found that visual sensitivity tuning can occur both towards shorter and longer wavelengths, thereby even reverting previous ontogenetic changes. This ability probably represents an adaptation to the temporally and spatially changing light conditions in the native habitat of these fish, a single crater lake in Nicaragua, by allowing them to freely and extremely rapidly adjust their visual system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d35e162"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="rsos190841_review_history.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank G.
