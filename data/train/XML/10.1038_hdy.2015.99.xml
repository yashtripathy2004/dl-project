<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">INTRODUCTION<p><s>Population history, demography and behaviour all interact to shape the genetic diversity of a species.</s><s>Species with fragmented or reduced populations often have low levels of genetic diversity.</s><s>In contrast, high genetic diversity is consistent with long-term stability in population size, whereas low levels of population differentiation suggest connectivity or recent population expansion.</s><s>As a rule, cetaceans are known to have low genetic diversity in comparison with terrestrial mammals and this is hypothesized to be due to slow mutation rates <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">(Jackson et al., 2009)</ref> and demographic factors such as recent population expansion following bottlenecks or behaviour <ref target="#b53" type="bibr">(Oremus et al., 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Patterns of population structure are evident in most cetacean species, even those with seemingly continuous distributions and high mobility.</s><s>For example, many baleen whales are highly philopatric, returning to calving or feeding grounds each year, leading to patterns of population structure between these grounds <ref type="bibr">(Alter et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The long lifespan of these animals, and extended period of maternal care, allows the cultural transmission of this philopatry over long time periods despite significant population depletion.</s><s>In killer whales (Orcinus orca), population differentiation is thought to result from a highly matrifocal social system <ref target="#b32" type="bibr">(Hoelzel et al., 1998)</ref>.</s><s>It has been suggested that the lack of gene flow between such matrifocal groups has, in the longer term, led to the development of sympatric subspecies that are specific to a particular habitat or prey <ref target="#b50" type="bibr">(Morin et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, some wide-ranging cetacean species show local specialization.</s><s>For example, common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) are a highly mobile pelagic species, yet genetic differentiation has been detected between animals from South Australia and those from the eastern coast of Tasmania, ~1500 km apart <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">(Bilgmann et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>This differentiation is likely due to a dependence on specific regional oceanographic features such as upwellings that influence prey distributions, for example, the Bonney Upwelling <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">(Butler et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Whether these trends are evident in beaked whales has previously been unknown, and difficult to quantify given the problem with obtaining genetic samples.</s></p><p><s>Although patterns of population structure are known in other cetaceans, beaked whales remain enigmatic, with few published studies describing their populations.</s><s>The ziphiids, or beaked whales, are one of the most speciose families of cetaceans, second only to the delphinids.</s><s>Of the 22 species of beaked whale, 15 can be found within the genus Mesoplodon.</s><s>Members of this genus are cryptic in their appearance and behaviour <ref target="#b57" type="bibr">(Pitman, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>It has been assumed that their general biology is similar and most are thought to be deep-diving squid eaters that live in small groups along continental shelf edges.</s><s>However, much of the information on the biology of these whales is derived from stranded animals combined with extrapolation from data collected on the few species that can be observed at sea (e.g., <ref target="#b84" type="bibr">Wimmer and Whitehead, 2004;</ref><ref target="#b46" type="bibr">McSweeney et al., 2007)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Long-term cetacean sighting surveys off the east coast of the United States suggest that beaked whales cluster into ecological niches that are different from all other odontocetes <ref target="#b67" type="bibr">(Schick et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>For example, Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris) and Sowerby's (Mesoplodon bidens) beaked whales occupy a different area of the continental shelf than do other squid-eating species such as sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus).</s><s>Moreover, there is evidence that these two beaked whale species may, in turn, occupy slightly different habitats within this area.</s><s>Tagging data from Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) have revealed a relationship between foraging behaviour and oceanographic features, for example, water depth, movements of the deep scattering layer of mesopelagic prey and seabed topography <ref target="#b37" type="bibr">(Johnson et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, tagging data suggest that Cuvier's beaked whales perform the deepest dives of all mammals, almost 3000 m <ref target="#b68" type="bibr">(Schorr et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, modelling implies that beaked whales require larger, higher quality habitats than other cetaceans to meet the energetic needs of such deep diving <ref target="#b86" type="bibr">(Wright et al., 2011;</ref><ref target="#b52" type="bibr">New et al., 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Where surveys have facilitated population size estimates, for example, west coast United States, it has been found that many beaked whale species have undergone significant population declines <ref target="#b49" type="bibr">(Moore and Barlow, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>As beaked whales are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic noise, it is speculated that these population declines are because of an increase in anthropogenic disturbance, further highlighting the need for a better understanding of the basic spatial requirements of all beaked whale species globally <ref target="#b82" type="bibr">(Weilgart, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>However, in most areas of the world, and for most beaked whale species, these data are not available.</s><s>The status of species inhabiting the remote areas of the Southern Ocean and seas around New Zealand is, as yet, undetermined.</s></p><p><s>New Zealand has the highest recorded number of species of stranded beaked whale in the world; 13 of the 22 recognized species, and some of the most rarely sighted <ref target="#b72" type="bibr">(Thompson et al., 2012;</ref><ref target="#b73" type="bibr">Thompson et al., 2013;</ref><ref target="#b10" type="bibr">Constantine et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>One of the most frequent species to strand around the coast is the Gray's beaked whale (Mesoplodon grayi) (Figure <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>This whale is a medium-sized (4.0-5.5 m) mesoplodont with a circumpolar southern hemisphere distribution (Figure <ref target="#fig_1" type="figure">2a</ref>).</s><s>Distributions have been primarily inferred from analyses of stranding data and live sightings are extremely rare.</s><s>Most records are generally from south of 33°latitude, particularly on New Zealand, Australian, South African and South American coasts, including the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic waters, with one record from the Netherlands <ref target="#b7" type="bibr">(Boschema, 1950;</ref><ref target="#b14" type="bibr">Dalebout et al., 2004;</ref><ref target="#b71" type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2008;</ref><ref target="#b77" type="bibr">Van Waerebeek et al., 2010;</ref><ref target="#b66" type="bibr">Scheidat et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Similar to other beaked whales, Gray's are assumed to live along the continental shelf edge, although there are occasional sightings of animals in shallow waters (e.g., <ref target="#b14" type="bibr">Dalebout et al., 2004</ref>).</s><s>An analysis of stranding patterns around New Zealand suggests that summer peaks are associated with inshore movements related to calving or nursing, particularly around the North Island <ref target="#b73" type="bibr">(Thompson et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, Gray's beaked whales have subtle morphological differences between the east and west coasts of New Zealand <ref target="#b74" type="bibr">(Thompson et al., 2014)</ref> and this might indicate restricted gene flow between the two coasts.</s></p><p><s>Behavioural studies of other beaked whales, for example, the northern bottlenose whale (Hyperoodon ampullatus), suggest specific dependencies on oceanographic features, such as submarine canyons, have resulted in genetically isolated populations <ref target="#b15" type="bibr">(Dalebout et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>To date, there is no information on the foraging habitat or prey of Gray's beaked whales, although <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">MacLeod et al. (2003)</ref> have speculated that this species relies more on small benthic fish than other beaked whales.</s><s>The seabed topography around New Zealand is diverse, supporting a variety of mesopelagic squid and fish (De <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">Leo et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Around the continental shelf edge, there are several areas of periodic high primary productivity resulting from upwelling of slope-associated deep water <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">(MacDiarmid et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Many marine mammals are known to take advantage of these upwellings for foraging <ref target="#b75" type="bibr">(Torres, 2013;</ref><ref target="#b64" type="bibr">Sagnol et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>In the case of Gray's beaked whales, it is unclear whether the species take advantage of these upwellings, although stranding patterns appear to indicate use of the highly productive areas of the continental shelf of the north east of the North Island of New Zealand, particularly in summer <ref target="#b73" type="bibr">(Thompson et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>We hypothesize that, given the spatial scale from the east to west coast of New Zealand, we would expect genetic structure in Gray's beaked whales in line with morphological differences, with habitat dependency, as a result of specialization to local prey or breeding areas, as the driver of differentiation.</s><s>Furthermore, we suggest that such genetic divergence is likely to be greater over a larger spatial scale (6000 km) between the Chatham Islands and Western Australia.</s></p><p><s>To test this hypothesis, we analysed sequence data from 530 bp of mitochondrial control region and 12 variable microsatellite loci to investigate diversity, population structure and effective population size from 94 Gray's beaked whale samples.</s><s>These samples were collected from strandings around the coast of New Zealand, with an additional six samples from Western Australia representing the largest global collection of this species.</s><s>We provide novel insights into the population dynamics of this enigmatic, and rarely sighted, species.</s></p></div>
