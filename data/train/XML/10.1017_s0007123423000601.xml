<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Introduction<p><s>The last few electoral cycles in Europe have been unkind to the continent's historic centre-left, with social democrats in Austria (2019), <ref type="bibr">Belgium (2019)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">France (2017)</ref>, Germany (2017), Ireland (2020), and the Netherlands (2019) all registering post-war electoral nadirs.</s><s>Britain's Labour Party is no exception.</s><s>In 2019, Labour gained its lowest seat share since 1935, losing several symbolically important 'heartland' constituencies held almost continuously since the adoption of universal suffrage <ref target="#b31" type="bibr">(Goes 2020)</ref>.</s><s>Autopsies of the campaign revealed disproportionate losses among manual workers and those with low incomes <ref target="#b25" type="bibr">(Fieldhouse et al. 2023;</ref><ref target="#b32" type="bibr">Goodwin and Heath 2020;</ref><ref target="#b61" type="bibr">McDonnell and Curtis 2019)</ref>; painful statistics considering that these were the exact groups for whom the party was founded to represent (Labour Party 2021a; <ref type="bibr">Thorpe 2015, 8-35)</ref>.</s><s>For many, Labour had alienated its working class base once too often in recent decades, with equivocation over 'Brexit' being the final straw <ref target="#b9" type="bibr">(Bickerton 2019;</ref><ref target="#b32" type="bibr">Goodwin and Heath 2020</ref>).</s><s>Yet, the narrative of a working class exodus from Labour perhaps oversimplifies things.</s><s>Among UK parliamentary constituencies in the top quintile of deprivationa composite measure encompassing average attainment in income, employment, housing, etc. -Labour did indeed lose traditional, underprivileged strongholds like Stoke-on-Trent North and Bishop Auckland.</s><s>However, it held others, such as Bradford West and Bethnal Green, with increased majorities (Rae 2021; <ref target="#b89" type="bibr">Wainwright 2019</ref>).</s><s>There is one obvious difference between these four working class constituencies: while the first two are over 90 per cent white, the latter are over 50 per cent black and Asian <ref target="#b6" type="bibr">(Barton 2020)</ref>.</s><s>Data from the British Election Study Internet Panel (BESIP) following the 2019 election establishes an ethnic divide among the working class.</s><s>Among lower technical, routine and semi-routine employees (encompassing service workers such as cleaners and carers, as well as industrial workers), Labour support was around 59 per cent among ethnic minorities, but only 29 per cent among whites. 1</s><s>Labour failed to connect with the white working class (WWC) specifically.</s></p><p><s>This paper investigates whether perceptions of the party's representation of different demographics can help explain this puzzle.</s><s>Evidence suggests that Labour has maintained its reputation as the party for minorities more successfully than its reputation as the party for the (white) working class <ref type="bibr">(Heath et al. 2013, 13)</ref>.</s><s>Others argue that Labour's focus on ethnic minority interests (among other 'new' social movements) has reduced its standing among WWC voters <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">(Ehsan and Stokes 2021;</ref><ref target="#b65" type="bibr">O'Neill 2021)</ref>.</s><s>Similar claims have been made about the Democratic Party in America <ref target="#b28" type="bibr">(Fukuyama 2018;</ref><ref target="#b54" type="bibr">Lilla 2016)</ref>.</s><s>These authors allege a shift in the priorities of social democrats from addressing class-based economic issues to 'identity politics' and the mobilization of a range of sociocultural grievances associated with historically marginalized, principally non-economic, social groups, such as ethnic minorities <ref target="#b8" type="bibr">(Berman and Snegovaya 2019)</ref>.</s><s>This has, the argument goes, eroded attachment to the centre-left among 'traditional' supporters, who view efforts to represent such groups as, at best, competition for attention and, at worst, actually harmful to their interests <ref target="#b54" type="bibr">(Lilla 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This argument echoes <ref target="#b69" type="bibr">Przeworski and Sprague's (1986)</ref> identification of a 'dilemma of electoral socialism'.</s><s>Reaching out to middle class voters in response to the declining size of their working class base would reduce the latter's loyalty to the centre-left by eroding the parties' pro-working class brand (see also <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">Evans and Tilley (2017)</ref>, <ref target="#b40" type="bibr">Heath (2015)</ref>, and <ref target="#b86" type="bibr">Thau (2021)</ref>).</s><s>Thus far, however, few, if any, have explored whether perceptions of social democratic attempts to represent non-whites have had a similarly demobilising effect on WWC support.</s><s>Is this a new dilemma of electoral socialism?</s><s>Do WWC voters view Labour as disproportionately focused on minorities to the exclusion of their interests?</s><s>While feelings of displacement have been ascribed to WWC subjects in influential ethnographies <ref type="bibr">(Gest 2016, 39;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hochschild 2016, 137-39)</ref>, we are unaware of any study that has investigated these questions directly.</s></p><p><s>We proceed as follows.</s><s>First, we note that Labour's electoral coalition has changed from one dominated by the WWC to a tripolar alliance highly reliant on non-whites and white graduates.</s><s>We hypothesize that the WWC, more so than their graduate co-ethnics, may react negatively to the party's greater association with non-white representation.</s><s>We distinguish between 'ethnocentrism' and 'relative political deprivation' based explanations for this.</s><s>We then test these claims using BESIP data.</s><s>Our findings partially support the thesis that associations with minority interests can undermine social democrat WWC support.</s><s>First, the WWC are more likely than others to say that Labour represents minorities better than the working class.</s><s>Second, subjective ratings of how well Labour represents both groups are less positively correlated among WWC respondents.</s><s>Third, net of several attitudinal controls, the WWC are less likely to support Labour when they associate the party with minority interests.</s><s>These results cannot be fully explained by the WWC's higher average levels of ethnocentrism.</s><s>Instead, we argue that a substantial proportion of the WWC believe they have been relatively deprived of representation vis-à-vis other Labour coalition members in recent years and have reacted negatively.</s><s>We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and the extent to which they might be generalizable. 1 Authors' calculations from BESIP Wave 19 data <ref type="bibr">(non-voters excluded)</ref>.</s><s>The initial 30-point gap between white (n = 3,255) and non-white (n = 91) working class voters remains at 18 points after controlling for age, education, income, and homeownership.</s></p><p><s>A New Dilemma of Electoral Socialism?</s><s>Analysts of British politics often claim that Labour, like other European centre-left parties, is struggling to hold together its twenty-first-century coalition of, on the one hand, industrial and lower-skilled service workers and, on the other, an increasingly large cohort of university graduates <ref target="#b1" type="bibr">(Abou-Chadi and Wagner 2020;</ref><ref target="#b26" type="bibr">Ford and Goodwin 2017;</ref><ref target="#b30" type="bibr">Gingrich 2017;</ref><ref target="#b38" type="bibr">Harris 2022;</ref><ref target="#b64" type="bibr">Oesch and Rennwald 2018;</ref><ref target="#b67" type="bibr">Piketty 2020)</ref>.</s><s>Following <ref type="bibr">Sobolewska and Ford (2020, 70-3)</ref>, we conceptualize Labour's support as having changed over time from domination by the (formerly, overwhelmingly white) working class to a 'tripolar' coalition between a reduced white working class (WWC), and also white graduates and ethnic minorities.</s></p><p><s>We define the first group as white, lower technical, routine or semi-routine employees without a university degree; the second as white university graduates and current students; and the last as all non-white or mixed-race respondents regardless of occupation or education. 2</s><s>Using nationally representative British Election Study (BES) data from 1987 and 2019 (two defeats where the party gained roughly one-third of votes nationally), Fig. <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">1</ref> details the percentage of the entire electorate and Labour voters who belonged to each group in either year.</s><s>In 1987, over half of Labour's votes came from the WWC, despite this group making up less than two-fifths of the overall electorate.</s><s>Graduates and non-whitesdespite the latter being heavily pro-Labourcollectively contributed just 17 per cent of the party's votes due to their relative scarcity.</s><s>In 2019, after three decades of post-industrialization, educational expansion, rising diversity, and, consequently, shifting Labour Party strategy <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">(Evans and Tilley 2017;</ref><ref target="#b30" type="bibr">Gingrich 2017;</ref><ref target="#b82" type="bibr">Sobolewska and Ford 2020)</ref>, this had all changed.</s><s>While these three groups collectively contributed over two-thirds of the party's support, just as in 1987, the relative contribution of each had shifted dramatically.</s><s>Due to dwindling numbers, rising abstention, and increased support for rival parties, only 18 per cent of Labour supporters were from the WWC, a statistical underrepresentation.</s><s>By contrast, the enlarged white graduate and minority voter blocs were now overrepresented, making up 26 per cent and 13 per cent of the entire British electorate but 38 per cent and 20 per cent of Labour supporters.</s><s>Labour had moved from near dependency on a single constituency to a diverse, 'tripolar' coalition.</s></p><p><s>Labour's tripolar coalition is large but potentially fragile, given that its members differ in their values.</s><s>In line with previous studies <ref type="bibr">(Evans and Tilley 2017, 83;</ref><ref target="#b38" type="bibr">Harris 2022;</ref><ref target="#b82" type="bibr">Sobolewska and Ford 2020)</ref>, Appendix 1 shows that the three groups are ideologically similar on economic leftright issues, but the WWC are notably more authoritarian and ethnocentric.</s><s>The relative social conservatism of ethnic majority working class populations has long been recognized <ref target="#b55" type="bibr">(Lipset 1959)</ref>.</s><s>However, many analysts have highlighted that, as the political salience of immigration and international integration has risen, tensions between social democratic parties and their base have become full-on schisms, and some working class voters have drifted toward conservative and right-wing populist parties that better represent their positions on these issues <ref target="#b27" type="bibr">(Ford and Jennings 2020;</ref><ref target="#b43" type="bibr">Hooghe and Marks 2018;</ref><ref target="#b50" type="bibr">Kriesi et al. 2008;</ref><ref target="#b64" type="bibr">Oesch and Rennwald 2018;</ref><ref target="#b74" type="bibr">Rydgren 2013</ref>; although, see Abou-Chadi, Mitteregger, and Mudde 2021 for a critique of this narrative).</s><s>Indeed, Labour's WWC problem can partially be explained by their recent positions on several controversial 'sociocultural' issues <ref target="#b26" type="bibr">(Ford and Goodwin 2017)</ref>.</s><s><ref target="#b82" type="bibr">Sobolewska and Ford (2020)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Evans and Tilley (2017, 83)</ref> demonstrate that the working class have long displayed Euroscepticism and opposition to immigration, putting them at odds with the rhetoric and policy of recent Labour leaders and most graduate voters.</s><s>Given that Britain's ethnic minority population are more liberal on border regulations and were notably less likely than whites to support leaving the EU <ref type="bibr">(Clarke, Goodwin, and Whiteley 2017, 154-5;</ref><ref type="bibr">Heath et al. 2013, 66-7)</ref>, one could surmise that the black and Asian working class were less disillusioned with Labour's increasing internationalism since the 1980s.</s></p><p><s>That said, particular divisive issues are only partially explanatory.</s><s>First, Labour's leadership and positions have always been more socially liberal than their prototypical supporters.</s><s>In the 1960s, Labour was far more popular among the working class than the more socially tolerant middle classes, despite abolishing the death penalty, legalizing homosexuality and abortion, and enacting several landmark race relations acts <ref type="bibr">(Evans and Tilley 2017, 68-79;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sobolewska and Ford 2020, 190-8;</ref><ref type="bibr">Thorpe 2015, 173-80)</ref>.</s><s>Second, Labour's social liberalism poorly serves its average non-white supporter in other ways.</s><s>While ethnic minorities are relatively permissive on issues of immigration and policing, they are more conservative on questions of gender and homosexuality <ref type="bibr">(Collins, Drinkwater, and Jennings 2020, 23;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sobolewska and Ford 2020, 70-2)</ref>, yet there has been no similar anti-Labour backlash from this community <ref target="#b58" type="bibr">(Martin 2019)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We do not deny that the role of high-profile 'issues' is a challenge that Labour and other social democratic parties face in trying to maintain their modern electoral coalition.</s><s>However, considering the shifting balance of power within the party's electorate, we contend there is also the potential for an even deeper conflict over exactly who Labour fundamentally belongs to, whose interests it should prioritize, and how achievable positive sum representation of different social groups is in practice.</s><s>In a nutshell, we argue that the rising importance of non-white voters to Labour's overall vote share and subsequent increased efforts by Labour to portray itself as the party for ethnic minorities may alienate WWC voters.</s></p><p><s>This perspective is not entirely novel.</s><s>Popular understandings of parties as defenders of specific social groups rather than custodians of particular ideological traditions have long been acknowledged <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">(Butler and Stokes 1974;</ref><ref target="#b11" type="bibr">Campbell et al. 1960)</ref>, and such theories have resurged in recent years <ref target="#b44" type="bibr">(Huddy 2013)</ref>, especially within the USA where associations of 'Democrat' or 'Republican' with particular ethnoreligious identities are deeply ingrained <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">(Achen and Bartels 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Put simply, awareness of the 'sort of people' that each party tends to help is often more widespread than accurate knowledge of politicians' stances, ideology, and policies <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">(Achen and Bartels 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Butler and Stokes 1974, 336-7;</ref><ref target="#b11" type="bibr">Campbell et al. 1960;</ref><ref target="#b80" type="bibr">Smith 2019)</ref>, and assessments of the links between parties and social groups seem to help shape political identities <ref target="#b4" type="bibr">(Ahler and Sood 2018)</ref>.</s><s>When a voter believes that a party is more closely associated with an 'outgroup' they dislikewhether because they deem it a rival for resources or because of base prejudicethe likelihood of them supporting the said party declines <ref type="bibr">(Kane, Mason, and Wronski 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mason, Wronski, and Kane 2021;</ref><ref target="#b91" type="bibr">Zhirkov and Valentino 2022)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In consequence, the public's understanding of who 'fits' where politically is not just influenced by policy and high profile 'issues' but also by cheaper heuristics such as a party referring to one's group in speeches, nominating co-group candidates and, crucially, avoiding associating itself with the representatives, emblems, and stances of rival groups <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">(Evans and Tilley 2017;</ref><ref target="#b40" type="bibr">Heath 2015;</ref><ref target="#b57" type="bibr">Lupu 2016;</ref><ref target="#b73" type="bibr">Robison et al. 2021)</ref>.</s><s>This makes group voting distinct from policy voting per se.</s><s>For instance, in Europe, social democrats' appeals to the growing middle classes are argued to have undermined working class perceptions that these were parties 'for them' <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">(Evans and Tilley 2017;</ref><ref target="#b69" type="bibr">Przeworski and Sprague 1986)</ref>.</s><s>It was not just more centrist policies on tax and redistribution that demobilized the working class, however, but also the changing demographic make-up of the party elite and their abandonment of references to workers' lifestyles and challenges in their rhetoric <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">(Evans and Tilley 2017;</ref><ref target="#b40" type="bibr">Heath 2015;</ref><ref target="#b73" type="bibr">Robison et al. 2021;</ref><ref target="#b85" type="bibr">Thau 2019</ref><ref target="#b86" type="bibr">, Thau 2021)</ref>.</s><s>In Britain, the change was dramatic.</s><s>While widespread in the mid-twentieth century <ref target="#b10" type="bibr">(Butler and Stokes 1974)</ref>, perceptions of Labour as a party for the working class declined substantially during the 1990s and 2000s <ref type="bibr">(Evans and Tilley 2017, 43;</ref><ref type="bibr">130-5)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Having previously alienated sections of its working class electorate by appearing too closely linked with middle class aspirations and interests, might Labour be in danger of losing the remainder over its appeals to minorities?</s><s>Labour has certainly redoubled efforts to appeal to the non-white electorate.</s><s>The party greatly expanded their stock of minority MPs, established and granted executive committee representation to an affiliated society for all non-white members ('Labour BAME'), and made increasingly explicit appeals to the challenges facing non-white Britons, including vocal support for the Black Lives Matter campaign <ref target="#b35" type="bibr">(Gregory 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Labour Party 2021b;</ref><ref type="bibr">BBC News 2019)</ref>.</s><s>Critics argue that Labour's alleged fixation with non-white voters undermines its ability to adequately represent its traditional constituencies, with the relative paucity of references to the working class in recent party publications being highlighted as indicative <ref target="#b19" type="bibr">(Ehsan and Stokes 2021)</ref>.</s><s>Working class understandings of representation as a zero-sum game may also have been enhanced because minority representation in parliament accelerated when the number of WWC MPs declined precipitously <ref type="bibr">(Campbell and Heath 2021, 1;</ref><ref type="bibr">710-11)</ref>.</s><s>Whatever the exact cause, in 2010, only 63 per cent of white British people believed that Labour looked after working class interests 'very' or 'fairly' well, whereas 80 per cent said this of the party's representation of black and Asian people <ref type="bibr">(Heath et al. 2013, 93-4)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A non-trivial proportion of whites saw Labour as a party for ethnic minorities rather than the working classes per se, but did this erode attachments to Labour?</s><s>Surprisingly, the relevance of a new (racialized) dilemma of electoral socialism has not been directly tested.</s><s>True, several observational and experimental studies have examined the impact of socially liberal positions on race and immigration on centre-left support, with some reporting a positive effect (Abou-Chadi and Wagner 2020; <ref target="#b39" type="bibr">Häusermann et al. 2021</ref>) and others uncovering more negative outcomes <ref target="#b5" type="bibr">(Angelucci and Vittori 2023)</ref>.</s><s>However, these studies cannot answer our research questions because they measure responses to observed or experimentally manipulated positions on policies rather than assessments of how well parties represent different groups.</s><s>More relevantly, <ref target="#b16" type="bibr">Dancygier (2010)</ref> argues that the potential political power of non-whites can exacerbate ethnic tension because natives may fear that local politicians will no longer be responsive to their needs.</s><s>However, neither that nor her subsequent research on the 'inclusion dilemma' facing centre-left parties who field Muslim candidates <ref target="#b17" type="bibr">(Dancygier 2017</ref>) explicitly measure the extent to which native working class populations associate these parties with minorities.</s><s>We fill this gap by directly measuring voters' associations of the Labour Party with different social groups.</s><s>We hypothesize that the association of the centre-left with non-whites will erode their WWC support; however, we also advance previous discussions theoretically by distinguishing between two potential mechanisms. <ref target="#foot_2" type="foot">3</ref> First, underlying hostility to other racial groups (ethnocentrism) and, second, fear of losing representation of one's own group (relative political deprivation).</s></p><p><s>Why Might Minority Representation Reduce the Centre-Left's White Working Class Support?</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ethnocentrism<p><s>Ethnocentrism is the tendency 'to reduce society to us and them' <ref type="bibr">(Kinder and Kam 2009, 37)</ref> and to combine 'a positive attitude toward one's own ethnic/cultural group … with a negative attitude toward the other' (Adorno 1950 in <ref type="bibr">Motyl 2001, 153-4)</ref>.</s><s>Ethnocentric voters may simply react negatively to Labour's attempts at improving the standing of non-whites due to outgroup prejudice.</s><s>Ethnocentrism is a reliable predictor of political behaviour in America, particularly increasing Republican support among lower-status whites <ref target="#b46" type="bibr">(Kam and Kinder 2012;</ref><ref target="#b49" type="bibr">Kinder and Kam 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, animus towards social groups commonly associated with a rival partywhich, in America, often means particular races or religionshas been shown to drive the recent hardening of partisan division and polarization in US politics <ref type="bibr">(Kane, Mason, and Wronski 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mason, Wronski, and Kane 2021;</ref><ref target="#b72" type="bibr">Robison and Moskowitz 2019;</ref><ref target="#b91" type="bibr">Zhirkov and Valentino 2022)</ref>.</s><s>Conversely, ethnocentrism is rarely measured in Britain, where the small size and heterogeneous nature of the minority population, in addition to its early enfranchisement, has historically limited the political capital available from mobilizing racial grievances <ref target="#b53" type="bibr">(Laniyonu 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sobolewska and Ford 2020, 15-16)</ref>.</s><s>That said, given evidence of racial prejudice in contemporary Britain <ref type="bibr">(Sobolewska and Ford 2020, 61)</ref> and accusations of racism being commonly levelled at critics of social movements such as Black Lives Matter <ref target="#b59" type="bibr">(Mason 2021)</ref>, it is prudent to control for the possibility that ethnocentrism drives WWC suspicion of minority representation.</s></p><p><s>Any gap between the WWC and white graduates in their response to associations of Labour with non-white representation should dissipate once controlling for ethnocentrism if that is the cause.</s><s>Firstly, graduates are often less attached to their own ethnic 'in-group' than the working class, possibly because a higher social status reduces the psychological need to base one's identity and esteem on the achievements of the broader national community <ref target="#b48" type="bibr">(Kaufmann 2018;</ref><ref target="#b77" type="bibr">Shayo 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sobolewska and Ford 2020, 66-8)</ref>.</s><s>Secondly, copious research links university education with reduced hostility to ethnic 'out-groups', although the exact mechanism is disputed <ref target="#b76" type="bibr">(Scott 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sobolewska and Ford 2020, 66-8)</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Discussion and Conclusion<p><s>Are the white working classes really rejecting social democrats because they associate these parties with ethnic minority interests?</s><s>Despite widespread concern about the impact of 'identity politics' on centre-left party support ( Nor have efforts been undertaken to ascertain why this might occur.</s><s>Is it simply because of underlying hostility to the well-being of racial outgroups (ethnocentrism), or does it instead stem from the WWC's widely discussed <ref target="#b21" type="bibr">(Evans and Tilley 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gest 2016, 39;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hochschild 2016, 137-9)</ref> feelings of displacement by other groups at the forefront of politician's priorities and their fears about falling yet further down the agenda (relative political deprivation)?</s></p><p><s>In this paper, we examined these questions using recent BESIP data measuring perceptions of how well Labour represents particular social groups.</s><s>First, we showed that the WWC generally believe that Labour more closely looks after non-white interests than working class interests per se, particularly in comparison to other members of the party's new electoral coalition (graduates and minorities themselves).</s><s>Second, while the WWC do not generally view working class and minority representation in stark zero-sum terms, it is true that members of this community view the link between representing working class and ethnic minority interests as weaker than others do.</s><s>Third, while the WWC are more supportive of Labour when they associate the party with both working and middle class interests, positive evaluations of Labour's minority interest representation are a negative predictor of this group's support.</s><s>Finally, the belief that Labour represents minorities more closely than the working class is robustly associated with WWC voters shunning the party.</s><s>The same does not appear to be true for white graduates or ethnic minorities, who are either indifferent or slightly positively inclined, respectively, to a disproportionate focus on non-white interests.</s><s>Importantly, all of these results are robust to controlling for underlying levels of white ethnocentrism, suggesting that it is not just the WWC's greater distance from racial 'outgroups' that is driving these effects;
