Pathogens, in turn, try to counter-act, subvert, or alter these responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The progression through different stages of infection therefore involves an array of complex interactions between the host and the pathogen proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Virulent strains of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> can evade the immune response and remain in a dormant (or latent) stage within the host cell for prolonged periods (often for several years), without causing any symptoms before reactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. To adapt to the &#x02018;hostile&#x02019; intra-cellular environment of the host, the cells of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> undergo several physiological and metabolic changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. An elaborate response mechanism of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> against hypoxic (low oxygen) conditions is one of the primary features characterizing its state during latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Mycobacterial proteins involved in host-pathogen interactions are likely to play crucial roles in sensing the host environment and subsequently participate (directly or indirectly) in regulatory events, leading to physiological/ metabolic changes necessary for intra-cellular survival. Understanding of the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> survival strategies, including changes in gene regulatory cascades as well as metabolism, would therefore remain incomplete unless studied in context of the host-pathogen interactions.</p><p id="Par16">The following aspects pertaining to intra-cellular hypoxic survival of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> inside human macrophage cells have been investigated in this work.

The obtained set of HPIs was further filtered based on the following information curated from literature - (a) cellular localization of the participating proteins, and (b) gene expression profiles of the invading pathogen as well as that of the infected host cells. The final set of HPIs comprised of 178 intra-species PPIs involving 148 human and 30&#x000a0;Mtb proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) (also see described in Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The human and Mtb proteins participating in HPIs were also observed to be well connected with each other in the respective intra-species PPI networks (background networks). The human-Mtb HPI network, augmented with such intra-species interactions, comprised of 178 nodes and 391 edges (data not shown). A single large sub-network consisting of a majority of the proteins participating in the predicted HPIs (142 out of 148 human proteins and 24 out of 30&#x000a0;Mtb proteins), and five small sub-networks, each consisting of two or three nodes (proteins), could be identified from this HPI network. Similar network architecture of human-Mtb HPIs has also been reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Interestingly, the average degree of the constructed network (4.4) was found to be comparable to that of the organism specific (human as well as Mtb) PPI networks.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Host-Pathogen Interaction (HPI) network.

For example, the predicted interaction between the human protein CDC42 and bacterial Mtb protein CipA/ Rv0479c (both up-regulated during infection &#x02013; see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) assumes importance given to the role of CDC42 in cytoskeletal rearrangements of the host cell. Cytoskeletal rearrangement of the host cells during phagocytic uptake of invading pathogens has been reported in earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Another predicted HPI involving human nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Visfatin) and the Mtb protein gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT/Rv2394) could be linked to a possible defensive strategy of the pathogen against increased cellular levels of glutathione (GSH). GSH on cleavage by GGT forms a dipeptide [Cys(NO)-Gly] which has bactericidal effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. While upregulation of Visfatin during infection may induce higher cellular levels of GSH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], downregulation of GGT by Mtb is expected to play a protective role (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Among others, HPI pertaining to human protein ninjurin (NINJ1) and nitrate reductase (NarH) of Mtb may be noted for its probable role in reducing the nitrate mediated stress exerted by the host cell through ninjurin activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The superoxide dismutase protein (SodA) of Mtb was predicted to interact with a number of human proteins, re-emphasizing the role of SodA in Mtb pathogenecity. In particular, HPI involving human HLA class I histocompatibility antigen and the Mtb SodA indicated the possibility of the presence of a HLA specific epitopic region within the mycobacterial SodA. This notion is also supported by existing literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and assumes importance in antigen presentation for triggering host immune responses.</p><p id="Par19">The role of the human proteins (associated to the identified host-pathogen interactome) were investigated in context of the KEGG pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], in order to gauge the effect of Mtb infection on host metabolic/ functional pathways (details in Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Most of the interacting host proteins (89 out of 148 human proteins involved in HPIs) were seen to be associated with the KEGG Tuberculosis pathway (ko05152). In addition, host mechanisms associated with metabolic or biological functions like apoptosis, Toll-like receptor signalling, NOD-like receptor signalling, MAPK signalling, production of pro-inflamatory cytokines and Type-I inteferons were seen to be perturbed during Mtb infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Gene regulatory network (GRN) controlling hypoxic response in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv (Mtb)</title><p id="Par20">A set of 286 genes (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>), encompassing the <italic>dosR</italic> regulon and enduring hypoxic response (EHR), was identified to be involved in hypoxic response through literature mining and were integrated into a comprehensive gene regulatory network. The role of transcription factors (TF) network which orchestrates the gene regulatory events during Mtb hypoxic response was analysed using a multi-level Boolean modelling (details in Additional&#x000a0;files&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). A model was constructed for the network comprising of 24 TFs belonging to dosR and EHR regulons. Simulations of the model were performed using an initial state which mimicked the biological state (gene expression levels) at the beginning of hypoxic stress. For over 70% of the total TFs (nodes) in the network, the stable state values obtained from simulation were observed to be in coherence with the experimental values (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Apart from capturing the gradual changes in pattern of expression for most of the TFs, the model could replicate the oscillatory gene expression patterns of the two TFs (<italic>kstR</italic> and Rv0494) which were observed in an earlier reported study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] (Additional&#x000a0;files&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">The constructed Boolean model was further utilized to predict the key regulators that are essential for the survival of Mtb in the host intra-cellular environment. For this purpose, the downstream target genes corresponding to each of the 24 TFs were appended to the network (details in Additional files <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). An analysis of the topological properties of this extended network revealed a number of high degree nodes, such as DosR, Rv0081, Lsr2, CsoR and Rv0324. Earlier studies have indicated DosR and Rv0081 to be important hub regulators of Mtb hypoxic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Lsr2 has also been proposed earlier to be a global transcriptional regulator, which responds to variations in oxygen level, and thus contributes to persistent infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It is also probable that the other two high degree proteins (CsoR and Rv0324), also act as hub regulators of hypoxic response in Mtb due to the following reasons. CsoR has been reported to be involved in copper homeostasis and plays a probable role in intra-cellular survival and virulence of the pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. On the other hand, Rv0324 has been suggested to modulate cholesterol metabolism through enhancing the expression of another regulator KstR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">In addition to studying the static properties, the dynamic properties of the gene regulatory network (GRN) were also investigated through simulation of <italic>in silico</italic> mutant models (details in Additional files <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Since the steady state obtained from the simulations represents the state of proteins in enduring (or late) hypoxic response, analyses of such states pertaining to the mutants are expected to help in deciphering importance of the TFs in sustaining the response at late stages of infection. Simulation studies (single gene knock-outs) revealed that mutations in seven out of the 24 TFs, affected the behaviour of downstream genes significantly, when studied in terms of enriched pathways (details in Additional files <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). These seven TFs included CsoR, Rv0081, Rv2034, Lsr2, PhoP, Rv1985c and Rv0324. <italic>&#x00394;csoR</italic> was observed to have the most prominent effect, altering the pathway enrichment pattern of downstream genes by as much as ~&#x02009;37% (when compared to the wild type). Interestingly, despite being a high degree TF with a known role in hypoxic response, the <italic>dosR</italic> mutant did not exhibit any appreciable changes in the pathway enrichment patterns, when compared to the wild type Mtb. This indicates that, although DosR plays a crucial role in initiating hypoxic response, its role in maintenance of bacteriostasis and enduring hypoxic response is probably not very significant. An earlier study had also indicated a nominal effect of <italic>dosR</italic> deletion on bacteriostasis under hypoxic environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. On the other hand, the current observations further strengthens our hypothesis of CsoR being a hub regulator (of hypoxic response), influencing a number of pathways required by the bacteria to survive under intra-cellular stress at late stage of infection. In summary, the above observations suggest probable roles of CsoR and Rv0324 as key regulators of certain Mtb pathways which are required for adaptation to intra-cellular stress. However, a deeper probe would be required to understand the exact mechanisms of hypoxic regulation by these two TFs.</p><p id="Par23">Functional analysis of the genes encompassing the <italic>dosR</italic> regulon as well as enduring hypoxic response (EHR), provided further interesting insights into pathway level changes that are likely to occur in Mtb under hypoxic stress. Despite a large set of genes pertaining to both <italic>dosR</italic> regulon (33 out of 57) and enduring hypoxic response (EHR) (160 out of 230) remains unannotated till date, a majority of the &#x02018;annotated&#x02019; set was observed to be involved either in metabolic processes or stress response pathways. A pathway enrichment analysis was performed in order to identify the up and down regulated pathways under hypoxic stress (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Apart from stress response, the pathways enriched during EHR mainly included ether and glycerol metabolism as well as regulation of metabolic process (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). This finding complements earlier literature, wherein lipid has been reported to be the preferred energy source for intra-cellular survival of pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. On the other hand, the pathways observed to be negatively enriched during EHR were found to be related to metabolism of DNA and amino acids (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Reduced metabolism of DNA and amino acids are likely to help the pathogen in controlling its growth, which in turn may aid in evading the host immune response and maintain dormancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Pathways enriched in hypoxia associated genes of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv (Mtb).

Considering the imminent slower growth phase the pathogen is likely to encounter in the subsequent EHR stage, enhanced carbohydrate metabolism is contrary to expectations. Thus exact functional roles of the genes contributing to the enriched carbohydrate metabolic process were investigated. Only two initial hypoxic response genes were observed to be associated to this process, namely, <italic>otsB1</italic> (Rv2006) and <italic>glpQ1</italic> (Rv3842c). OtsB1 has been suggested to act as a trehalose monomycolate phosphatase, which participates in the synthesis of a cell-wall component arabinogalactan-mycolate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, no role in Mtb metabolism has been suggested yet for GlpQ1, a putative glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. These observations suggest that the enrichment of carbohydrate metabolism during initial hypoxic response (indicated in our analysis) probably pertains to maintenance or synthesis of the cell wall components under intra-cellular stress, and may not signify an enhanced energy metabolism.</p><p id="Par25">Pathways which were observed to be differentially &#x02018;enriched&#x02019; during early and enduring hypoxic response hinted at the distinct responsibilities shouldered by <italic>dosR</italic> and EHR regulons during hypoxic adaptation. While the pathogen, when exposed to host intra-cellular environment, initially employs certain stress response mechanisms to counter the host immune system, later stages of hypoxia is additionally characterized by gene regulatory events leading to a slower (or arrested) growth and a preference for lipids as energy source.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv (Mtb) metabolism under hypoxic conditions</title><p id="Par26">The environment inside the macrophage is typically hypoxic and is characterized by low pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

Observations made in the current analysis also suggested that genes corresponding to ether and glycerol metabolic processes could be enriched under hypoxic growth conditions (described in previous section). In order to obtain a deeper understanding of the effect of hypoxia on the metabolism of Mtb, we performed an <italic>in silico</italic> flux balance analysis (FBA) study (Additional files&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>).

Further, fluxes flowing through reactions of nucleotide metabolism (mostly purine metabolism) and amino acids metabolic pathways (pertaining to arginine, proline, glycine, serine and threonine, etc.) were found to be altered. In addition, redox reactions were also observed to carry differential flux under simulated normal and hypoxic conditions.

To summarize, certain enzymes corresponding to the PPP were found to be crucial for the survival of Mtb during hypoxia. Re-routing of metabolic flux through the PPP generates reducing equivalents (in the form of NADPH) which may help the Mtb cells to counter the oxidative stress asserted by the host during hypoxia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Cross-talk between <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv (Mtb) HPI network and gene regulatory network under hypoxic condition (hypoxic-GRN) with different cellular processes</title><sec id="Sec7"><title><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv (Mtb) cellular processes associated with the HPI network</title><p id="Par29">To probe whether the Mtb proteins participating in the predicted HPIs, as well as those involved in the hypoxic gene regulatory network (GRN), can influence other biological pathways/ processes, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were performed (see Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>).

Amongst these, the glycolytic process (GO:0006096) was observed to be up-regulated only during the early time points of infection. It is likely that intermediates of carbohydrate catabolic process are utilized for generation of ATP during early stages of infection. However, since prolonged hypoxia-induced glycolysis may have toxic effects on mycobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], a subsequent reduction in glycolytic processes may be necessitated by the cell during later stages of infection. It may further be noted in this context, that the metabolic pathway enrichment study also indicated enrichment of carbohydrate metabolic processes during early phases of hypoxia (as discussed in an earlier section). This apparent enrichment of carbohydrate metabolic processes could be attributed to trehalose production, which contributes to cell wall synthesis.</p><p id="Par31">Pentose-phosphate shunt pathway (GO:0006098) was also observed to be enriched during the early stages of infection. This pathway is known to provide reducing equivalents for reductive biosynthetic reactions in Mtb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and it&#x02019;s up-regulation may play a possible role in balancing ROI/RNI stress induced by the host cell. It is interesting to note that the up-regulation of the pentose phosphate pathway was also not sustained by the myobacteria till late infection time points. Further analysis on the gene expression profiles of the infecting mycobacterial cell as well as that of the host phagocyte (macrophage) revealed that the regulation of pentose-phosphate pathway (in Mtb) was temporally correlated with the human respiratory burst mechanism (Additional files&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

In addition, it is also likely that this up-regulation confers resistance to iron limitation and oxidative stress, as suggested in an earlier report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Influence of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv (Mtb) hypoxic GRN on cellular processes</title><p id="Par33">While evaluating the influence of hypoxic gene regulation on cellular processes, the set of proteins which are downstream to the transcription factors controlling hypoxia, and were &#x02018;active&#x02019; (i.e. &#x02018;turned-on&#x02019;) during the hypoxic steady state (obtained through Boolean model simulations &#x02013; see Supplementary Results), were considered for GO enrichment. The enriched GO terms thus obtained consisted of pathways like sulfate assimilation, metabolic compound salvage, cell cycle, etc. (Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">14</xref>). Amongst these, the sulfate assimilation pathway (GO:0000103) was observed to be around five fold up-regulated. This process has been reported to facilitate sulfate uptake from host and subsequently help in combating oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Interestingly, the iron-sulfur cluster assembly process (GO:0016226), was also obtained as one of the enriched (as well as up-regulated) pathways in the set of HPI associated Mtb proteins (as discussed in an earlier section). The results therefore indicate the role of iron-sulfur cluster assembly process and sulfate assimilation in conferring protection to Mtb against oxidative stress at late stages of infection.</p><p id="Par34">The current analysis also showed around five fold up-regulation of nucleotide, nucleoside and purine containing compound salvage pathways (GO:0043174, GO:0043173 and GO:0043101 respectively) at late stage of infection. The role of pyrimidine salvage pathway in intra-cellular survival of Mtb at latent state has been implicated earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Thus the observed enrichment of salvage pathways may pertain to the pathogen&#x02019;s strategy for survival inside the host cell, while minimizing expenditure of cellular resources in de novo synthesis of the respective compounds.</p><p id="Par35">In addition to the above mentioned pathways, cell cycle (GO:0007049) was also observed to be enriched, as well as up-regulated. Since this observation is contrary to the anticipated non-replicating physiology of Mtb inside the host cell, the exact roles of the genes/ proteins contributing to the observed enrichment were investigated. Out of six such proteins, three (EccC2, EccC3 and EccC5) were found to be homologs of a cell division protein FtsK. These proteins have been reported to belong to the ESAT-6 Secretion System (ESX), involved in virulence and viability of the pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Wag31, one of the other proteins contributing to enrichment of cell cycle, was found to have a role in mitigation of oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] in addition to its role in cell division and cell shape regulation. Furthermore, the remaining two proteins from the list, viz. murC and murX, have been reported to be involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Therefore, the observed enrichment/ up-regulation of the &#x02018;cell cycle&#x02019; process probably pertains to up-regulated pathogenic processes like ESX, mitigation of oxidative stress, cell shape regulation and peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and may not be indicative of cell replication.</p><p id="Par36">Overall, the above observations suggest an up-regulation/ enrichment of cellular functions in Mtb which are helpful to counter the hostile environment of the host macrophage. This includes pathways for cell wall synthesis, sulfur assimilation, and oxidative stress mitigation. In addition, in an attempt to minimize its energy expenses, the Mtb cells probably utilize salvage pathways, especially for acquisition of nitrogen, iron and sulfur when present inside the macrophage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Influence of HPI network and GRN on hypoxic metabolism of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv (Mtb)</title><p id="Par37">The previous sections pertained to understanding three different aspects of Mtb adaptation to the host intra-cellular environment. While the Mtb proteins involved in HPIs are expected to play a major role in sensing the host environment, its GRN is likely to govern the necessary adaptive changes.

All shortest paths (of path-length&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;=5) between proteins involved in different modules were computed. Further, to ensure that the identified shortest paths had some relevance in flow of information between the studied modules, they were filtered based on gene expression of constituent nodes (during infection).

One would expect that (B) the gene regulatory network controlling hypoxic response would have a significant effect on (C) the hypoxic metabolism. However, the above observations suggest that the effect of (A) the HPIs on (C) hypoxic metabolism may be far more pronounced. The findings are probably indicative of the fact that many TFs that could be responsible for adaptation of Mtb to hypoxia are not yet known or characterized. Consequently, the shortest paths between (A) HPI and (C) hypoxic-metabolism were screened to ascertain whether they consisted of any TFs which have not been reported to be associated with hypoxic gene regulation in any earlier study. Six Mtb TFs could be identified which are not part of (B) the hypoxic-GRN presented in this attempt. Two of these TFs, viz.

However, the exact regulatory cascades haven&#x02019;t been identified yet. No literature evidence of association to hypoxia could be found for the remaining four identified TFs (Rv0097c, Rv1287, Rv1460 and Rv2359).

Further, the &#x02018;KEGG Tuberculosis pathway (ko05152)&#x02019; was seen to encompass 89 (out of 148 human proteins) which were predicted to be involved in the HPIs. These findings re-emphasize the relevance of the predicted interactions and the proteins involved therein.</p><p id="Par43">A key aspect of Mtb&#x02019;s survival in the intra-cellular environment is its adaptation to hypoxia. Earlier studies dealing with this aspect of Mtb survival had identified several genes involved in the process through computational as well as experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Given that most of these studies were disparate, an attempt was made to (a) collate all relevant information through literature mining, and (b) built a simulable model to study hypoxic gene regulation in Mtb. The genes regulated by <italic>dosR</italic>-induced initial response were seen to be enriched in functions like maintenance of cell wall, thereby indicating the pathogen&#x02019;s preference to optimize resource or energy utilization for cell protection, before the onset of metabolic re-routing to utilize lipids and attain a viable but non-growing phenotype during the subsequent EHR stage. Further, simulation results identified a novel role for CsoR (Rv0967), which was observed to be a hub regulator of EHR. Given the known role of copper in mitigating oxidative stress (through SodC-mediation) in Mtb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], further experiments investigating the regulatory effects of CsoR is likely to provide additional insights into Mtb virulence.</p><p id="Par44">The hypoxic metabolism of Mtb was studied using FBA simulations. In contrast to earlier attempts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], a minimal set of constraints (low oxygen uptake and a change in primary energy source) were employed to decipher the intrinsic pattern of flux re-routing during hypoxia (also see Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>). Such changes are solely driven by the network architecture of the metabolic network and are expected to be the strongest determinant of metabolic changes during hypoxic adaptation. Mutant strains of Mtb lacking genes for glycolysis or gluconeogenesis and PPP were seen to be challenged for growth/ metabolism during hypoxia. These observations probably hint at a mechanism wherein Mtb counters the intra-cellular oxidative stress by generation of reducing equivalents through the PPP. Further, the scarcity of available sugars (coupled by arrested growth during infection) probably triggers Mtb to reverse the flow of flux through its glycolytic pathways to store glycogen for future use.</p><p id="Par45">In addition to looking at the genes/ proteins/ enzymes directly involved in the investigated HPI, GRN or the metabolic network, the functional aspects of their neighbours were assessed in order to understand the influence of the former on other cellular processes. Despite no overlap between the constructed HPI network and the 24 TFs controlling hypoxic gene regulation, key cellular processes enriched in the &#x02018;downstream&#x02019; PPI cascade of both these networks pertained to iron and sulfur assimilation and carbohydrate metabolism pathways involved in synthesis of cell wall components. Other processes associated with the HPI network which probably play an active role during intercellular survival of Mtb included PPP and synthesis of precursor metabolites. The hypoxic-GRN on the other hand had sulfate uptake, metabolic salvage pathways, and cell cycle amongst its list of downstream pathways/ processes that were seen to be modulated during hypoxia. While sulfate uptake and metabolic salvage pathways have obvious implication in a phagocytosed Mtb cell sourcing precursor metabolites from the host, redirection of flux towards cell wall synthesis and gluconeogenesis have earlier been reported in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] as well as in our investigations into hypoxic metabolism. These hints indicating the possible overlap and inter connections between different cellular processes involved in Mtb&#x02019;s intra-cellular survival led us to probe the links deeper through a shortest PPI path analysis. The results indicated a significantly enriched set of PPIs connecting the HPI network to the Mtb&#x02019;s hypoxic metabolism. This was particularly intriguing, given that one would expect the GRN controlling hypoxic response to exert a more prominent effect on hypoxic metabolism. While our observations strengthen the premise of a concerted effort of different sensory and regulatory networks of Mtb in driving the metabolic changes during hypoxic adaptation, it raises a question regarding the completeness of our current understanding of TFs and gene regulation pertaining to hypoxia.</p><p id="Par46">Experimental validation of certain interesting regulatory and metabolic aspects identified in this study can potentially enrich our current understanding of tuberculosis infection.
