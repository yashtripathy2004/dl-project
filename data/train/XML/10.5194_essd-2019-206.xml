<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Instrumentation<p><s>The instrumentation contained in the EN GHG system module has been described elsewhere <ref target="#b38" type="bibr">(Welp et al., 2013;</ref><ref target="#b36" type="bibr">Verhulst et al., 2017)</ref>; we will summarize the system here but refer the reader to those publications for further details, including additional equipment and part numbers.</s><s>Figure <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">4</ref> indicates the plumbing diagram of the typical tower setup.</s><s>Three inlet lines reach from the sampling location on the tower into the equipment housed in a full-size rack inside a shed at the base of the tower.</s><s>Typically, two inlet lines pull air from the topmost level and one at a lower level on the tower.</s><s>Stafford, Virginia (SFD) is the exception with inlets at three different levels (50 m, 100 m, and 152 m).</s><s>At some sites there was no space to house the equipment in existing structures, so small single-or double-rack sized enclosures were purchased and installed.</s><s>Air is pulled through a filter into the inlet lines (0.953 cm (3/8") OD Synflex 1300) that are continuously flushed at ~10 L min -1 by aquarium pumps (Alita AL-6SA).</s><s>The three air lines are connected to a rotary multi-port valve (MPV; 8-port, VICI, Valco Instruments Co. Inc.) housed within a sample control box (calibration box).</s><s>Two or three calibration standards are also connected to the MPV with 0.156 cm (1/16") stainless steel tubing.</s><s>The control system for the MPV directs the air stream to the analyser cycling every 20 minutes through each of the three inlet lines, and every 22 hours through each standard (Section 3.2).</s><s>The common port of the MPV is connected to a pressure controller that reduces the pressure to 80 kPa (800 mb), after which the sample (either ambient air or air from a standard gas cylinder) enters a 183 cm long Nafion dryer (Permapure, Inc., model MD-050-72S-1) where it is dried to a water vapor mole fraction of ~0.1 % prior to flowing through the cavity ringdown spectroscopic (CRDS) analyser <ref type="bibr">(Picarro, Inc., Model 2301)</ref>.</s><s>The lower-than-ambient inlet pressure of 80 kPa is prescribed in order to lower the flow rate of the analyser to ~70 standard cm 3 min -1 .</s><s>At Mashpee, Massachusetts (MSH), a CRDS Model 2401 analyser is operational, and this is the only site currently also measuring carbon monoxide (CO) in addition to CO2 and CH4.</s><s>The CRDS analysers report measurements of dry air mole fraction of each gas in air, also known as the mole fraction, i.e., moles of the trace gas per mole of dry air.</s><s>Throughout, we refer to these measurements in units of µmol mol -1 for CO2 and nmol mol -1 for CH4 and CO, following the SI recommendations (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures, 2019).</s><s>Software (GCWerks, Inc.) installed on a separate mini-PC computer at each site controls the run cycle and the MPV selection valve.</s><s>The data is collected on this computer and sent to the central EN data server, also running GCWerks.</s><s>All data is processed on the central EN data server but additional post-processing and uncertainty assignment to hourly observations is performed at NIST.</s><s>As recommended by the WMO, the software has the capability of re-processing all the data from the original raw files, thus can accommodate any changes to the assigned values of the standards (due to a reference scale update, for example) at any time <ref type="bibr">(WMO, 2018)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Calibration cylinders<p><s>When the Earth Networks GHG monitoring system was established in 2011, each site hosted two calibration cylinders (standards) with ambient level dry air mole fractions as part of the original system design.</s><s>This continues to be the case at most NEC sites.</s><s>At the NEC sites, these standards have values close to 400 µmol mol -1 dry air CO2, 1890 nmol mol -1 dry air CH4 and 115 nmol mol -1 dry air CO (at MSH only) and are sampled by the analyser periodically, in a sequence identical to that described for the Los Angeles Megacity network in <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">Verhulst et al. (2017)</ref>.</s><s>The standards are purchased from the World Meteorological Association (WMO) Central Calibration Laboratory (CCL), the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth System Research Laboratory (NOAA/ESRL) Global Monitoring Division in Boulder, Colorado, USA, where they have been calibrated on the WMO scales (X2007 for CO2, X2004A for CH4, and X2014A for CO <ref target="#b43" type="bibr">(Zhao et al., 1997;</ref><ref target="#b4" type="bibr">Dlugokencky et al., 2005;</ref><ref target="#b23" type="bibr">Novelli et al., 2003)</ref>).</s><s>One of these two cylinders serves as a standard for calibration and driftcorrection while the second serves as a target tank or check standard.</s><s>The target tank is used for data-quality checks and uncertainty calculations (Section 4).</s><s>The residual of the target tank (the RMS difference between its value assignment when treated as an unknown and its reference value from NOAA) is a critical indicator of data quality and is monitored in order to alert the operators of any general problems in the system such as leaks, mistakes in the assignment of MPV ports, or drift in calibration tank value.</s><s>In the field, all gas standards are sampled for 20 minutes every 22 hours.</s><s>In data processing, the first 10 minutes of any tank run are filtered out to allow for the system equilibration.</s><s>In some cases when the standard runs were found not to equilibrate as quickly as desired, 15 minutes of data were filtered, until the problem could be fixed (typically either contamination or inadequate regulator flushing).</s></p><p><s>At a few NEC sites (currently BWD and MSH, with more planned), a third gas cylinder is installed at the site to serve as a permanent high-concentration standard (referred to as the high standard), to improve calibration and reduce uncertainties.</s><s>This standard typically contains air with a mole fraction of CO2 close to 500 µmol mol -1 , CH4 at approximately 2300 nmol mol -1 to 2500 nmol mol -1 , and at MSH, CO near 320 nmol mol -1 .</s><s>At MSH, this cylinder has been provided directly by NOAA/ESRL, while at BWD this cylinder was purchased as natural whole air from Scott-Marrin, Inc (now Praxair).</s><s>The Scott-Marrin air is stripped of its original trace gases (CO2, CH4, CO, hydrocarbons, etc.) with CO2, CH4, and CO added back in to prescribed values.</s><s>Several such standards have been purchased with the intent to place them at urban stations to serve as high standards after calibrating them onto the WMO scales.</s><s>We note that because they are being used together with NOAA/ESRL standards in the field, it is essential that these standards also be assigned values on the same scales.</s><s>This calibration is transferred in the NIST laboratory using five standards calibrated and purchased from NOAA/ESRL.</s><s>The CO2 in the Scott-Marrin cylinders is isotopically different (in terms of the 12/13 C ratio in CO2) from the ambient air tanks that are filled by NOAA/ESRL at Niwot Ridge, Colorado.</s><s>However, the calibration is transferred from the NOAA standards to the Scott-Marrin gases using the same model (Picarro 2301) analyser used in the field (i.e.</s><s>measuring only 12 CO2) in the NIST laboratory, effectively cancelling out the error that would be caused by this isotopic mismatch <ref target="#b3" type="bibr">(Chen et al., 2010;</ref><ref target="#b30" type="bibr">Santoni et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the CO2 values assigned by NIST to these standards are effectively the total dry air mole fraction of CO2 the cylinders would contain if they were isotopically similar to the NOAA cylinders.</s></p><p><s>Additional sites in the network also benefit from the improved calibration method in cases where measurements of a high standard were performed prior to analyser deployment (NWB, NEB, JES, TMD, CPH, and HRD).</s><s>Prior to system installation at these sites, tests were conducted at the EN laboratory in which the designated analyser was set up measuring the calibration standard, target standard, and a high-value standard at ~490 µmol mol -1 CO2, ~2560 nmol mol -1 CH4 daily for several days (enough for 3-5 measurements of 20 minutes each).</s><s>This single high standard cylinder was also calibrated by and purchased from NOAA/ESRL, with assigned values on the WMO scales.</s><s>These laboratory tests allow the determination of the secondary correction to the instrument response, or sensitivity, as described in Section 3.4.</s></p><p><s>The high standard gas measurements are used to perform a secondary correction (Section 3.4) to the original one-point calibration described in <ref target="#b36" type="bibr">Verhulst et al. (2017)</ref> and in Section 3.3., reducing the uncertainty of the measurements.</s><s>We note that while in principle a secondary correction is desirable, and the uncertainty is indeed reduced by its implementation (see Section 4.2), it remains quite small relative to the signals of interest in an urban network.</s><s>Deployment of high standards at all sites has not yet occurred due to both costs and logistical and operational constraints; for example, at many sites the space available for the equipment is limited and prohibits the installation of a permanent third tank.</s><s>Thus, we plan to implement a round-robin procedure circulating additional standards at various values through the network to evaluate the calibrations and implement the secondary correction throughout the network.</s><s>Although the current state of having two different calibration methods coexisting in the network is not ideal, we aim to implement the secondary correction throughout the network as soon as possible.</s></p></div>

(2017)</ref> Table <ref type="table">S2</ref> and two additional units at NIST) average to 0.03 µmol mol -1 for CO2 between the calibration and high standard, and larger for the test that included an even higher-concentration tank, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> at ~711 µmol mol -1 for CO2.</s><s>The fit uncertainty encompasses (at 1-sigma) this residual as well (Fig. <ref type="figure">7(b)</ref>).</s><s>The residuals at lower values can be explained by the uncertainty in the measurement (precision) and uncertainty in value assignment of the tanks.</s><s>For CO, only eight tests were available, with a mean residual inside the range of the calibrations of 1.1 nmol mol -1 , higher than the reported reproducibility from NOAA of 0.4 nmol mol -1 (all values are noted here at 1-sigma although they are given by NOAA at 2sigma).</s><s>This larger residual is likely caused by the lower precision of the analysers for CO but also could be caused by larger uncertainty in the tank assignments, possibly due to drift in the mole fraction of the tanks themselves.</s><s>We intend to conduct additional tests outside the two-point calibration range with additional analysers and tanks to evaluate and possibly update this uncertainty component, Ufit, as needed, and especially focus on CO if/when additional CO measurements are added to our network.</s></p></div>
