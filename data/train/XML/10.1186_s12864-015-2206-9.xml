In order to prevent the spread of this disease a thorough understanding of the Tasmanian devil immune system and its response to the disease is required. In 2011 and 2012 two genome sequencing projects of the Tasmania devil were released. This has provided us with the raw data required to begin to investigate the Tasmanian devil immunome in depth.

The devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) is currently threatening Tasmanian devils with extinction. Since its emergence around 1996, the disease has spread rapidly across the state resulting in a population decline of around 80&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This had led to Tasmanian devils being listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. An unusual feature of DFTD is that it is transmitted as an allograft when Tasmanian devils bite each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This makes DFTD one of only three naturally occurring clonally transmissible tumours along with canine transmissible venereal tumour in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and a recently identified transmissible cancer in clams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This tumour is able to transmit between unrelated hosts without eliciting an immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], but how this tumour avoids the host immune system is not fully understood. The tumour down-regulates cell surface Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), which allows the tumour to &#x02018;hide&#x02019; from the host immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, these observations do not fully account for the ability of DFTD to avoid immune recognition, as a lack of MHC expression should still elicit a NK cell response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the past, investigation into the immunology of the Tasmanian devil and its immune response to the tumour has been hampered by a lack of genomic and immunological resources. Characterisation of immune gene repertoires is important for the development of specific immune reagents necessary for vaccine development. In addition, gene identification and specific reagents are required for devil specific assays such as qPCR, immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry. Since 2012 two Tasmanian devil genomes have been available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], one of which is available on the Ensembl genome browser. While many Tasmanian devil genes have been annotated in the Ensembl pipeline, numerous divergent genes of the immune system were missed by the Ensembl annotation or have been poorly annotated. Several families of the Tasmanian devil immune system have been characterised in previous studies, including natural killer cell receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], major histocompatibility complex (MHC; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]) and toll-like receptors (TLR; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]). Several additional divergent immune gene families, important for characterisation of immune response, have not been investigated in the Tasmanian devil, including cytokine families, immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors. Within the marsupials these families have been best characterised in the gray short-tailed opossum (<italic>Monodelphis domestica</italic>), for which a good quality genome assembly is available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Some genes have also been characterised in additional marsupials including tammar wallaby (<italic>Macropus eugenii</italic>), brushtail possum (<italic>Trichosurus vulpecula</italic>) and koala (<italic>Phascolarctos cinereus</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Research into the marsupials thus far has demonstrated that the marsupial immunome is similar to that of eutherian species, although notable differences occur including marsupial specific expansions within chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the absence of IgD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and the presence of a T cell receptor found only in marsupials and monotremes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Cytokines are a diverse group of secreted proteins produced by a broad range of cells that act as mediators of the immune system. Different cytokine profiles are associated with Th1 and Th2 immune responses, and thus can be used to characterise the immune response to pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Groups of cytokines include chemokines, interleukins, interferons, tumour necrosis factors (TNF) and growth factors. Interleukins are a diverse group of cytokines; in humans there are 36 interleukins with roles in cell proliferation, maturation, migration and adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], while 34 interleukins have been identified in opossum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Chemokines are involved in inflammation, cell migration, activation and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Within the chemokines are four subclasses defined by their characteristic spacing of cysteine residues (C, CC, CXC and, CX3C). The chemokine family is a dynamically evolving family, with some chemokines being conserved among vertebrates, while lineage specific duplications of chemokines are seen particularly within the CC and CXC subclasses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Interferons are related group of cytokines with a critical role in anti-viral immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Within the interferons are three subclasses. Type I contains several members including IFN-&#x003b1; - &#x003b2; and -&#x003ba; while the Type II interferon class has a single member (IFN-&#x003b3;). In the opossum seven IFN-&#x003b1; genes have been identified, while single - &#x003b2;, - &#x003ba; and -&#x003b3; are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Type III interferons are known as IFN-&#x003bb; interferons. Tumour necrosis factors are a family of cytokines that can elicit apoptosis of cells and in humans, 19 members of this family have been recognised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>There are two antigen receptor systems in vertebrates that allow for antigen specific binding: immunoglobulins (Ig) and T cell receptors (TCR). Immunoglobulins, produced by B cells, are formed by two identical heavy and light chains with each chain consisting of a constant and a variable region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Multiple heavy chain constant regions are encoded in the genome and these determine the isotype of the immunoglobulin. There are five Ig isotypes present in mammals, which are defined by their heavy chain constant region (A, D, G, E, M) and there are two light chain classes seen in vertebrates (&#x003bb; and &#x003ba;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In the marsupials single A, G, E and M regions have been identified, as well as single &#x003ba; and multiple &#x003bb; domains, while an ortholog to D has not been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>T cell receptors allow for recognition of MHC bound antigens. These receptors are made of two TCR chains. Like Igs, TCR contain variable regions and constant regions which define the chain class. These chains include &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b4; and &#x003b3; in all studied mammalian species; these classes may contain single or multiple constant domain loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Within the marsupials and monotremes exists an additional TCR chain, &#x003bc;, which in studied species has multiple constant domain loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Little is known about these genes in marsupials outside of the opossum. However, the opossum, an American marsupial, diverged from Australian marsupials about 80 million years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore we expect to see differences in the immune gene repertoires of these two species. In this study we identify and characterise these divergent immune gene families within the Tasmanian devil genome assembly. To aid in immune gene identification and characterisation we have produced transcriptomes for Tasmanian devil lymph and spleen.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We have used multiple data sources and a combination of search methods to locate divergent Tasmanian devil immune genes. The data sources include two genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and five transcriptomes (testis, tumour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], milk, spleen and lymph; see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for accession numbers). Search methods utilised included basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) searches, hidden Markov model (HMMER) searches and searches based on conserved synteny. We report the identification of 141 Tasmanian devil immune genes including cytokines, chemokines, Igs and TCRs. All identified sequences have been deposited into a publicly available database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hp580.angis.org.au/tagbase/gutentag/">http://hp580.angis.org.au/tagbase/gutentag/</ext-link>).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Interleukins</title><p>A total of 40 interleukin genes were predicted from the Tasmanian devil genome (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Of these 28 were orthologs of human interleukins while the remaining 11 represented marsupial or devil specific duplications. These included three homologs of human <italic>IL18</italic> and two genes related to the IL-36 family of genes in eutherian mammals. <italic>IL18</italic> is highly conserved among most vertebrate lineages, being present as a single copy in species of fish, birds, reptiles and mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Although only a single <italic>IL18</italic> ortholog was identified in a previous study on opossums [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] an additional <italic>IL18</italic> homolog was identified by the Ensembl annotation [Ensembl:ENSMODG00000014381] adjacent to the previously identified <italic>IL18</italic>. To our knowledge duplication of the <italic>IL18</italic> locus has not been previously reported in any species. To explore the evolutionary relationships between mammalian IL-18 sequences a phylogeny was constructed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The single identified wallaby IL-18 forms an orthologous relationship to one of the devil and opossum IL-18 sequences. The second opossum sequence appears to be orthologous to a second devil sequence, while the third devil sequence has no clear orthologue. This indicates that the duplication of <italic>IL18</italic> may have occurred early on marsupial evolution rather than representing lineage specific duplications within marsupial lineages. Only one of the copies of <italic>IL18</italic> was expressed in the available Tasmanian devil transcriptomes (<italic>IL18A</italic>; expressed in testis, tumour and milk transcriptomes; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) so it has yet to be seen whether the additional copies are expressed.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary table of cytokine, immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor sequences identified in Tasmanian devil</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Interleukins</th><th>Chemokines</th><th>TNF family</th><th>Ig constant regions</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>IL10</td><td>CC family</td><td>TNF</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>IL11</td><td>CCL26</td><td>LTA</td><td>G</td></tr><tr><td>IL12A</td><td>CCLD1<sup>a</sup>

Bootstrap value greater than 50&#x000a0;% only are displayed. There are three sequences (Devil A, B and C) in the Tasmanian devil and two (Opossum A and B) in the opossum due to duplications in the genome of these species</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2015_2206_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>A full length <italic>IL22</italic> gene was identified in the Tasmanian devil genome. This gene had five exons, as in the human <italic>IL22</italic>. However, an additional five partial genes or gene fragments were identified, representing at least three unique <italic>IL22</italic>-like loci. An alignment of all the Tasmanian devil IL-22 sequences identified is shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>. These gene fragments were all identified in short or highly fragmented contigs, therefore these fragments may be part of full <italic>IL22</italic> sequences. Some of the fragments identified could potentially be part of the same gene, for example the sequences <italic>IL22F3</italic>, - <italic>F4</italic>, and <italic>-F5</italic> could combine to encode a full <italic>IL22</italic> sequence. One of the <italic>IL22</italic> sequences (<italic>IL22F1</italic>) had no introns, and therefore is likely to be a processed pseudogene. A processed pseudogene is produced from the reverse transcription of an mRNA transcript with subsequent reintegration into chromosomal DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Interestingly, this sequence shows higher identity to the <italic>IL22F3</italic> and <italic>IL22F4</italic> fragments (both sequences with introns), than the <italic>IL22</italic> sequence. Therefore the <italic>IL22F1</italic> sequence more likely was generated from the transcript of one (or both) of these sequences than from the <italic>IL22</italic> sequence. This provides further evidence that there is more than one full length <italic>IL22</italic> gene in the Tasmanian devil genome. In most species, including opossum, <italic>IL22</italic> is represented by a single sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, a duplication at the locus is seen in some strains of mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. None of the Tasmanian devil <italic>IL22</italic> sequences were identified in the devil transcriptomes. Further investigation will be required to determine whether the Tasmanian devil may have more than one functional <italic>IL22</italic> gene.</p><p>Orthologs of the genes <italic>IL3</italic>, <italic>IL32</italic> and <italic>IL37</italic> were not identified. Orthologs to <italic>IL32</italic> and <italic>IL37</italic> have not, to our knowledge, been identified to any animal outside of eutherian mammals, including both opossum and wallaby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore it is likely that these two interleukins are specific to eutherian mammals. As in the opossum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], <italic>IL3</italic> could not be identified in the Tasmanian devil genome, despite being present in both eutherian mammals and chicken. The syntenic region in the Tasmanian devil genome was searched, but as in opossum, this region was fragmented, so it is possible that this gene could not be identified due to this fragmentation. In total 13 of the 40 interleukin sequences were identified in one or more Tasmanian devil transcriptomes, with <italic>IL16</italic> being the most ubiquitously expressed, being expressed in all five transcriptomes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Chemokines</title><p>Thirty-nine chemokines were identified in the Tasmanian devil genome (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). This is greater than that identified in the opossum (36) and the chicken (24), but less than the human (47) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Twenty-four chemokines of the CC family were identified, including orthologs to ten eutherian CCL chemokines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Genes <italic>CCLD5-CCLD10</italic> appear to form a devil specific expansion (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and are likely to have duplicated recently due to their high identity (93.4&#x02013;97.8&#x000a0;% amino acid identity) and their proximity to each other in the Tasmanian devil genome (See Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). These sequences lack direct orthology even to opossum sequences, and appear to be related to the human <italic>CCL4</italic> family. In addition, two pseudogenes related to this group were also identified in the Tasmanian devil genome, with either frame shifts or early stop codons. One CCL chemokine not identified, despite being identified in the opossum genome was <italic>CCL5</italic>.

The genomic region syntenic to the opossum region containing <italic>CCL5</italic> was fragmented in the Tasmanian devil genome which may explain why this gene cannot be located. <italic>CCL16</italic> was not identified in devil or opossum, and this gene appears to be present only in the eutherian lineage. <italic>CCL6</italic>, <italic>9</italic>, and <italic>12</italic> were also not found, but these genes have thus far only been identified in rodents.

Devil <italic>TNFSF18</italic> could not be identified using BLAST or HMMER searches, but was identified based on the conserved synteny of the region. <italic>TNFSF18</italic> was highly divergent from eutherian orthologs, with only 17&#x000a0;% amino acid identity between Tasmanian devil and human sequences, accounting for the difficulty in predicting this gene. <italic>TNFSF10L</italic>, a gene present in fish, birds and monotremes, but not in eutherian mammals, was also identified in the Tasmanian devil genome. In opossum, the <italic>FASLG</italic> sequence contained a frame shift mutation and its receptor <italic>FAS</italic> could not be identified, despite using the same search strategies used in the current study, leading to speculation that this ligand and receptor may not be functional in the opossum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, <italic>FASLG</italic> was identified in the Tasmanian devil genome without any features to suggest that it is a pseudogene and <italic>FAS</italic> was also identified.

This indicates that the regions containing these genes may contain repetitive elements making them difficult to assemble. This also highlighted errors in the Ensembl 7.1 assembly; while the majority of the <italic>TNFSF11</italic> sequence was identified on a scaffold GL849887.1 flanked by two other genes, the first half of exon 1 was located on scaffold GL864876.1, within the intron of another gene. In addition the last exon was located on a third scaffold, GL851272.1. This arrangement is highly unlikely to represent the actual genomic arrangement and is likely the result of an error in the assembly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Additional cytokines</title><p>Fourteen additional cytokines not belonging to one of the above families were searched for, including the colony-stimulating factors and the transforming growth factor families (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Orthologs to all of these genes were located in the Tasmanian devil genome, including <italic>CNTF</italic> which has not been previously predicted in marsupials.

As with the other marsupial species, such as wallaby and possum, that have been studied, the D locus could not be identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It is likely that this region has been lost in all marsupials. While G and A are often represented by multiple constant domain loci in eutherian mammals, as in other marsupials studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], these are only represented by single loci in the Tasmanian devil. The A, E and G loci were located adjacent to one another on a single scaffold while M was located on another scaffold. All four heavy chain loci were expressed in both the lymph and milk transcriptomes.</p><p>As in most other species the &#x003ba; light chain is represented by a single locus in the Tasmanian devil genome. Four &#x003bb; constant chains were identified compared to eight in the opossum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The K and L loci were all located on separate scaffolds in the Tasmanian devil genome, indicating that this region is highly fragmented. Due to this it is possible that there may be additional L loci in the Tasmanian devil genome that could not be identified due to fragmentation.

Therefore it is possible that in the Tasmanian devil light chain expression is dominated by single &#x003ba; and &#x003bb; light chains.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>T cell receptors</title><p>T cell receptor constant domains were also identified in the Tasmanian devil genome (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>). Within most vertebrate mammals there are four TCR constant domains; &#x003b1; and &#x003b4; which are typically found at the same locus, and &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; which form unique genomic loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These are commonly represented by a single constant domain, except for &#x003b2; which is usually duplicated. Marsupials and monotremes have an additional TCR locus, the M locus, which contains multiple &#x003bc; constant domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Constant domains from these five loci were identified in the Tasmanian devil genome. As with other mammals, the &#x003b1; and &#x003b4; constant domains were found in close proximity, on contig GL834496.1. Three &#x003b2; domains were identified, compared to four which have been identified in opossum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The single &#x003b3; constant domain was also identified. A total of six &#x003bc; constant domains were identified compared to eight in the opossum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, these were spread across five contigs in the Tasmanian devil genome, with most of these contigs being short and/or fragmented, so it is possible that additional domains exist that could not be identified due to fragmentation of the genome assembly. Heterodimers are formed by the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; chains, and the &#x003b4; and &#x003b3; chains; in humans 95&#x000a0;% of TCR expression is composed of the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; heterodimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Within the lymph&#x000a0;node transcriptome &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; transcripts (<italic>TRBC1</italic>) were expressed, but not &#x003b4; and &#x003b3;, indicating that the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; heterodimer may also dominate in the Tasmanian devil. Within the milk transcriptome <italic>TRGC</italic> and an additional &#x003b2; (<italic>TRBC2</italic>) were also identified. In addition &#x003bc; chains were identified in both the lymph (<italic>TRMC4</italic>) and milk (<italic>TRMC4</italic>, <italic>TRMC2</italic>, <italic>TRMC6</italic>) transcriptomes. While variable domains for both the Igs and TCRs were identified, due to the highly fragmented nature of these regions it is highly likely that a large number of variable domains are missing from the genome and determining the genomic arrangement is not possible with the current genome assembly. With additional work to improve assembly of these regions in the Tasmanian devil genome this will be possible in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Genome limitations</title><p>A recurring problem with gene identification was the fragmentation of the genome assembly in the regions containing genes of interest. In some cases only partial genes could be predicted, with the predicted location of exons being beyond the end of the scaffold or in a break in the scaffold. Additionally, entire genes could not be located, but their predicted location was between two genomic scaffolds. Within highly duplicated groups of genes that are predicted to occur in the same genomic locus, such as the <italic>TRMC</italic> genes or <italic>CCL</italic> genes, fragmentation of these regions means that family members may be missing from the genome assemblies, and due to this we cannot definitively determine the number of sequences within these families in this study. While fragmentation was also an issue in identifying sequences in the opossum genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the opossum genome generally has better coverage in these regions. For example the majority of <italic>CCL</italic> genes in the opossum could be identified in a single scaffold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], while the majority of these in Tasmanian devil were found individually on unique scaffolds. This fragmentation makes examining genomic synteny on a wide scale difficult. Despite the issues with fragmentation, the vast majority of genes searched for in the Tasmanian devil genome were identified in this study. Additionally, access to two genome assemblies was beneficial for identifying genes in this study. The Murchison et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] assembly, present on Ensembl, was the main genome used for gene identification as the scaffold length is generally much higher. However, genes missing, or partially missing from this assembly were located in the Miller et al.

Through the use of genomes and transcriptomes, diverse genes encoding critical components of the immune response can be identified and characterised, paving the way for future research into the immunology and diversity of the species. This is expected to be an increasingly important approach for research and conservation of threatened and endangered species in the future.</p><p>In this study a total of 141 immune genes were identified in the Tasmanian devil genome. While many of these were annotated in the Ensembl pipeline, 30&#x000a0;% of the genes searched for were either missed by the Ensembl annotation, or were poorly or partially annotated, particularly genes that are highly divergent from marsupial and eutherian orthologs. By using multiple data sources as well as targeted search methods, highly divergent genes were identified. In general, orthologs that were expected to be present in the Tasmanian devil genome were identified. Several eutherian genes that have not been previously identified in marsupials were also not identified in the Tasmanian devil, providing further evidence that these genes are likely to have either evolved within the eutherian lineage (including <italic>CCL6</italic>, <italic>CCL16</italic>, <italic>IL32</italic> and <italic>IL37</italic>) or have been deleted in the marsupial lineage (such as the IgD locus). A small number of genes that were expected to be present in the Tasmanian devil genome, including <italic>IFNK</italic> and <italic>CCL5</italic>, could not be identified by any method. The predicted locations of these genes are in fragmented regions of the genome assembly, and their absence from the transcriptomes is not unexpected. Therefore, it is more likely that these are missing from the genome assembly and not expressed in the transcriptomes, rather than being absent from the Tasmanian devil genome. Several genes that have not been previously identified in any marsupial species were identified in this study including <italic>IL23A</italic>, <italic>TNFSF18</italic> and <italic>CNTF</italic>.</p><p>Genes that formed devil or marsupial specific expansions were identified in the CXC and CC chemokine families and in the interferon &#x003b1; family. Expansions in these families have been previously seen in the opossum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In the CC family, five CCL genes represent a lineage specific expansion in the devil. In addition, several unexpected duplications were seen in the Tasmanian devil genome. This included duplication of the <italic>IL18</italic>, <italic>IL22</italic> and <italic>CXCL10</italic> genes. In the future it would be interesting to determine whether more than one of these duplicated loci is functional.</p><p>Discovery of these genes is the essential first step to many research projects in the Tasmanian devil. This includes the development of antibodies, such as anti-devil IgG or anti-devil CD8, which&#x000a0;allow for detailed immunological research of the devil and of DFTD, and for vaccine development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Identification of devil gene sequences are the first step for development of assays including qPCR, ELISA, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. These assays are crucial for investigating disease pathology and immune response in Tasmanian devils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Genes described in this paper can be used to develop antibodies against Th1 and Th2 cytokines to further characterise devils&#x02019; response to DFTD. In addition, discovery of these genes is essential for looking at genetic variation at these immune genes that could correlate to DFTD resistance and could vary across populations in the wild. Tasmanian devils have a lack of genetic diversity which is believed to have made the Tasmanian devil susceptible to disease outbreaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Any variation in these genes, particularly functional variation, will be essential to maintain both in the wild and in captivity. Targeted assays are now being developed to monitor genetic diversity in these genes both in the wild and captivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. With further research into the Tasmanian devil immune system and its response to DFTD, development of a vaccine or treatment for DFTD may be possible in the near future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Sample collection, RNA extraction and cDNA library preparation</title><p>Tasmanian devil tissue samples were collected under Animal Ethics permits DPIPWE AEC No. 21/2007-08.
