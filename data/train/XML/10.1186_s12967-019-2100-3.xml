RNA extracted from 58 archival formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor blocks (including 38 lung cancers, 5 melanomas, 10 renal carcinomas, 4 urothelial carcinomas and 1 colon carcinoma) was hybridized to a beta version of the NanoString<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> PanCancer IO360&#x02122; CodeSet using nCounter<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> technology. Gene expression signatures were correlated with tumor responses (by RECIST criteria) and overall survival.

A variety of biomarkers are currently being explored as strategies to enrich for clinical responders, and for some indications, approvals of the anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapeutic incorporate biomarker testing in the form of PD-L1 measurement by immunohistochemistry (IHC) into the prescribing label. Despite being cleared by the FDA as companion and/or complementary diagnostics for different anti-PD-1/PD-L1 drugs, PD-L1 IHC assays have a number of limitations, including suboptimal positive and negative predictive value and reproducibility. As ICI disrupt pathways that are conserved between tumor cells from multiple different tumor types and the immune environment, biomarkers which are predictive across a variety of indications are of particular interest.</p><p id="Par19">Several biomarkers have been developed which characterize either the potential for tumor cells to prime an adaptive immune response, e.g. tumor mutation burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI), or the downstream consequences of immune activation, as measured by presence of immune cells e.g. Immunoscore, or gene expression signature related to immune environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A number of candidate gene expression signatures have been developed, and most focus on biology of activated T cells and IFN&#x003b3; signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] Interestingly, defects in the IFN&#x003b3; signaling pathway have been identified as a mechanism of resistance, strongly supporting a crucial role of IFN&#x003b3; in the anti-cancer immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. An association between IFN&#x003b3; expression or IFN&#x003b3; inducible gene signature and clinical responses to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAb was reported in melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and bladder carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Recently an 18 gene &#x0201c;tumor inflammation signature&#x0201d; (TIS) which quantifies an activated but suppressed adaptive immune response in the tumor microenvironment, was demonstrated to retrospectively predict clinical benefit of anti-PD-1 in various cancer types (melanoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, digestive cancers, ovarian and triple negative breast cancers) in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The signature has been analytically validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and is currently under investigation in multiple Research Use Only (RUO) and Investigational Use Only (IUO) studies for performance as a predictive biomarker.</p><p id="Par20">In order to assess the feasibility and utility of gene expression profiling in routine clinical practice, we assessed the TIS score from a mixed tumor cohort of patients treated with anti-PD-1 on label at a single center as part of a larger transcriptional profiling study with the PanCancer IO360 gene expression panel.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p id="Par21">Fifty-eight patients from the CERTIM (Immunomodulatory Therapies Multidisciplinary Study group) were included in the study. The CERTIM cohort was initiated in our hospital in July 2015 and prospectively includes all the patients treated with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (either nivolumab or pembrolizumab) administered per label as a single agent, for advanced solid tumor. Treatment was continued until disease progression or intolerable toxicity, physician or patient decision. Tumor imaging by CT scan was performed at baseline, every 8&#x000a0;weeks for patients receiving nivolumab and every 6&#x000a0;weeks for patients receiving pembrolizumab through the first 6&#x000a0;months and every 12&#x000a0;weeks for both thereafter. Response was assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Clinically stable patients considered to be deriving clinical benefit could continue therapy until disease progression was confirmed on imaging done at least 4&#x000a0;weeks after the first assessment of stable disease. The toxicities observed in the patient cohort were monthly reviewed by the dedicated CERTIM multidisciplinary board. Clinical status was assessed monthly during treatment and continued when the treatment was stopped. Database lock-up was 9 February 2018. Median patients follow-up was 19.2&#x000a0;months.</p><p id="Par22">This study was approved by the ethics committee (CPP Ile de France II, no. 2008-133, 2012 06-12, 2018 MS1) in agreement with article L.1121-1 of French law.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>PD-L1 immunostaining</title><p id="Par23">For each tumor, we performed PD-L1 immunostaining on fresh-cut slides from representative FFPE blocks using an anti-PD-L1 antibody (E1L3N, Cell signaling) on Bond automat (Leica) as previously described and validated by the PATTERN French thoracic pathologists group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

DNA were sequenced on the Novaseq 6000 platform, using at least 100&#x000a0;ng of double stranded tumoral DNA (Qubit dsDNA HS kit). After shearing, 11 randomly selected samples were run on the Agilent Bioanalyzer to confirm successful shearing prior to library construction The SureSelect Human All Exon V6 capture kit was used to capture coding regions of genes included in the major genomic databases. Paired end FASTQ files of 101mer sequence reads were generated. All sequence data was quality controlled for read counts, quality values, kmer usage, GC-content, and all other relevant parameters with FastQC (v0.10.1). The DNA read sequences were aligned to the genome (UCSC hg19; Feb 2009 release) using BWA (v0.7.15) and reads sorting and PCR duplicate removal were conducted using Picard (v2.8.3). VarScan2 (v2.4.2) with Samtools mpileup (v1.3) was used to call SNVs/Indels against human reference genome. Germline polymorphisms were removed by retaining only variants with MAF in all races of &#x0003c;&#x02009;1% or unknown MAF within the 1000 genomes and NHLBI-ESP project with 6500 exome database. The retained SNVs/indels were further filtered by removing SNPs in dbSNP129.

The weighted scores used for calculation of the TIS and other signatures are NanoString intellectual property. For the correlation analysis with clinical response to treatment, clinical benefit was defined as complete or partial RECIST response while stable and progressive disease were defined as lack of clinical benefit. Normalized gene counts and signature scores were compared to the response category using a linear model. The log2 fold change, Wald-type confidence interval and <italic>p</italic>-value were calculated for each gene and signature (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2).

The clinical characteristics of the 58 patients with different cancer types included in this study are described in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Several genes showed a differential expression in responders to anti-PD-1 [patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST criteria] compared to non-responders (stable or progressive disease) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).

Since a number of the genes with greatest association with clinical benefit are contained within or closely related to genes in the TIS, we evaluated the TIS as a predictive biomarker in this cohort. In this study, a high TIS score was significantly associated with response to anti-PD-1 treatment (odds ratio&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.64, 95% CI [1.4; 6.0], <italic>p&#x02009;</italic>=&#x02009;0.008, Logistic regression) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b).

Overall, 7/37 (19%) patients responded to treatment. As in the whole cohort, we observed that TIS enriched for tumor response in NSCLC (odds ratio&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.27, 95% CI [1.2; 11.6], <italic>p&#x02009;</italic>=&#x02009;0.03, Logistic regression) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par31">The limited efficacy, potential toxicity and the cost of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 molecules in cancers patients calls for the use of predictive biomarkers. Our study focused on gene expression based biomarkers because they are compatible with current clinical practice, i.e. they can be performed with small tissue samples and using a local laboratory and have the potential for clinical utility across disease indications and therapeutic agents. The TIS was originally described as a biomarker predictive of response in patients with different cancer types, treated with pembrolizumab in the context of clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Here, we extend the characterization of TIS to include novel indications (NSCLC) and novel agents (nivolumab). One strength of this study is that it was performed on patients treated in the community setting; thus in a less selected patient population than in clinical trials and likely more reflective of larger real world performance. This study demonstrates an association of high TIS with ICI benefit, for both clinical response and overall survival, independently of carcinoma subtype and anti-PD-1 therapeutic molecule administered.</p><p id="Par32">The study has a number of limitations which must be considered in the interpretation of results. First, the study is composed of a small cohort of patients, especially the lung cancer cohort. Despite the small cohort size, the TIS was predictive of both response and survival, and thus may represent a realistic option for the identification of patients who may benefit from ICI. We await the availability of larger cohorts of patients treated with ICI in the real life management to confirm these results. Ultimately, prospective clinical trials using TIS as a stratifying biomarker are needed to definitely confirm its predictive value in different cancer types.</p><p id="Par33">It is worth considering the performance of the non-gene signature biomarkers in this study. Although it is the approved diagnostic, PD-L1 IHC was not observed to be predictive, which may be due to tissue heterogeneity and the cohort size. Small biopsies sometimes comprise small numbers of tumor cells and the positivity of these cells may not reflect the whole tumor status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Using multigene signatures such as the TIS may be a more robust way of measuring the presence of a cytotoxic anti-tumor immune response than measuring PD-L1 protein alone. Similarly, high TMB has been shown to be associated with ICI benefit, particularly in lung cancer, in numerous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], but it was not predictive in this cohort of NSCLC, nor was it correlated with TIS. This may be due to the limited number of cases studied, mixed histology (adenocarcinoma and SCC) and/or the fact that TMB was high in all samples (13.7 to 26.8 mutations/MB). Interestingly, a recent study established that TMB and TIS were independently predictive of clinical response to pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE clinical trials in a variety of tumors but without examining NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Further limiting its utility, at the current time TMB measurement is a costly technique, and is awaiting for international standardization and recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Finally, gene signatures beyond TIS may be required in the future to further dissect mechanisms of immune resistance in patients whose tumor does not respond to single agent PD-1/PD-L1 blockade to inform biology-based combinations. Specifically, while tumor inflammation gene signatures, including TIS, are measuring IFN biology and/or presence of specific T cell populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], additional signatures (which could be combined with TIS) are needed to gain further insight into additional processes associated with immune escape that could be targeted therapeutically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par35">In this study, gene expression signatures were analyzed in a cohort of FFPE tumor samples from cancer patients treated with anti-PD-1 in routine clinical care.
