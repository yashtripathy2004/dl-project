While microbial community composition has been shown to vary across continents and in traditional versus Westernized societies, few studies have examined urban-rural differences in neighboring communities within a single country undergoing rapid urbanization. In this study, we compared the gut microbiome, plasma metabolome, dietary habits, and health biomarkers of rural and urban people from a single Chinese province.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">We identified significant differences in the microbiota and microbiota-related plasma metabolites in rural versus recently urban subjects from the Hunan province of China. Microbes with higher relative abundance in Chinese urban samples have been associated with disease in other studies and were substantially more prevalent in the Human Microbiome Project cohort of American subjects. Furthermore, using whole metagenome sequencing, we found that urbanization was associated with a loss of microbial diversity and changes in the relative abundances of Viruses, Archaea, and Bacteria. Gene diversity, however, increased with urbanization, along with the proportion of reads associated with antibiotic resistance and virulence, which were strongly correlated with the presence of <italic>Escherichia</italic> and <italic>Shigella.</italic>

These changes are associated with increased crowding, altered diet, declines in physical activity, and increased risk of diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the effect of urbanization on the microbiome, the set of microorganisms that lives on or in a person, and how this affects disease risk, has not been explored in detail.</p><p id="Par13">The microbiome plays a crucial role in host function. Dysbiosis of the microbiota has been associated with a number of diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, obesity, and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], which are also associated with a Western lifestyle. Previous studies have shown some modest associations between the microbiome and diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, in all of these studies, which focused on subjects living similar lifestyles in the same geographical regions, the changes in microbial composition did not overcome inter-individual variation. In contrast, differences in microbial composition become much more pronounced when comparing geographically and culturally distant populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Few studies have addressed urban-rural differences in the microbial and metabolic composition of individuals living within a similar geographic area who share similar ethnicity and diet. This is especially true of recently urbanizing environments. Here, we look at the early stages of how the microbial community evolves in response to recent urbanization.</p><p id="Par14">China is an ideal place to analyze the complex interaction of microbiome, disease, and urbanization, as many areas within this country have only recently (in the past 20&#x000a0;years) started to undergo massive urbanization, and within a single region, one can still find a mix of traditional rural and more Westernized urban lifestyles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This is particularly true in the predominantly Han region of Southern China, which has large variation in timing of major urbanization-related changes. In this study, we analyzed the microbiome and metabolome of 40 subjects from Hunan province, 20 recently urbanized subjects, and 20 rural subjects. By focusing on urban-rural differences in the microbiota and metabolites of a single province, we were able to capture early alterations in response to urbanization, as well as eliminate some of the confounding factors in previous studies, such as ethnicity, geography, and regional dietary patterns. Our results suggest the possibility of a loss of beneficial microbes associated with urbanization, with a concomitant increase in potentially dangerous genes, leading to a more Westernized microbiome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Urbanization is associated with a shift in microbial community composition towards commonly observed Western gut microbes</title><p id="Par15">We compared 20 urban subjects from a city of 7 million to 20 rural subjects living in a small village in Hunan province.

</p><p id="Par16">We used 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing of fecal samples to assess the gut microbial community of our subjects at two timepoints, separated by 2&#x000a0;weeks (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Similar to others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], we found strong correlations between the samples taken at the two timepoints (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1). Using mixed linear models with urban/rural and time as fixed effects and subject id as a random effect, we found significant differences associated with urban vs. rural status in the first multidimensional scaling (MDS) axis at the operational taxonomic unit (OTU), genus, and family level (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>g). These differences became much less pronounced at the higher phylogenetic levels of phylum, class, and order. Our observation of increased separation at lower phylogenetic levels is supported by using a random forest classifier (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>h), which showed that when predicting urban vs. rural status, the area under the curve (AUC) increased with more refined taxonomic levels, with an AUC of over 70%, starting with the family level, suggesting that microbiome composition as measured by 16S rRNA sequencing can be used to differentiate urban and rural subjects at the family level or lower taxonomic levels. In addition, these findings are independent of method and could be reproduced using alternative tools for taxonomic assignment (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2) and classification (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S3). Intriguingly, while the urban samples had more diversity at the higher taxonomic levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S4), richness trended opposite to the diversity measures (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S4B), suggesting that this difference is driven by differences in evenness. Taken together, our results suggest that there are significant differences between rural and urban samples that overcame inter-individual variation, but become much less pronounced at higher taxonomic levels.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Differences in microbial composition between urban and rural Chinese subjects. <bold>a-f</bold> PCoA plot and comparison of Shannon diversity index for each taxonomic level, based on sequencing the 16S rRNA gene.

</p><p id="Par18">In order to compare our Chinese cohort to a Western cohort, we mapped taxa higher in rural or urban samples to their nearest taxa as represented by consensus sequences from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), which analyzed the microbiomes of healthy subjects living in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Similar to our findings with the SILVA database, we found no significant difference between how well taxa higher in rural or urban samples could be mapped to the HMP taxa (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). However, there was a substantial difference (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;13</sup>) between how prevalent the closest matching taxa within the HMP were (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e). The nearest matching HMP taxa was present in an average of 30.1% of HMP subjects for taxa higher in rural samples, compared to 63.7% for taxa higher in urban samples. This suggests that urbanization in China is associated with an increase in microbes that are present in higher numbers of people in Western (urbanized) America. Furthermore, we found differences in prevalence at <italic>P</italic> values above our 0.05 threshold, suggesting that a larger study would have resulted in more OTUs significantly different between rural and urban than the 25 OTUs we reported (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Figure S5).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The metabolome is strongly correlated with urbanization</title><p id="Par19">Metabolites are another sensitive marker of the host&#x02019;s state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In fact, previous studies have found that the metabolome changes more rapidly than the microbiome in response to host perturbations, such as diet change, suggesting that early response to host changes is transmitted through changes in microbial gene expression more than microbial composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Due to our finding that the microbiome was stable across timepoints, we generated metabolite data corresponding to the first timepoint from our analysis of the microbiome. We found significant differences between urban and rural metabolite composition (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a) that were independent of analysis method (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Figure S6), although there was no difference in the diversity of the metabolome. Furthermore, our machine learning classifier was even better at predicting urban/rural status from the metabolome than the microbiome (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). At an FDR-adjusted <italic>P</italic> value of <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05, there were 16 metabolites significantly associated with urban vs. rural status (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S2G).

Likewise, there were few associations between the microbiome and metadata or metabolome. For example, only five metadata variables were associated with any taxa: antibiotic use in the last 6&#x000a0;months (associated with 18 taxa), use of probiotic supplements (associated with three OTUs), insulin levels (associated with two OTUs), and gender and fat intake (each associated with one OTU; Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Table S3).

A few of these correlated variables measured the same value in different ways, such as glucose, which was measured both as an independent blood test in the metadata and as a metabolite in our metabolomics data (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Figure S7). This strong correlation in the variables measured in two independent ways validates our metabolomic methods. The majority of the statistically significant associations between the metabolites and the metadata, however, revealed intriguing novel associations between the metabolome and health. For example, among our 133 statistically significant associations, 106 (80%) fell into the amino acid, carbohydrate, lipid, and peptide superpathways. The eight metabolites associated with BMI, waist or weight were all in the peptide, amino acid, or carbohydrate superpathways. The 23 metabolites associated with glucose, HbA1c, and insulin largely fell in glucose metabolism pathways, while the 17 metabolites associated with cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL largely fell in lipid metabolism pathways.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The relative abundance of Viruses and Archaea is decreased in urban subjects</title><p id="Par22">While 16S rRNA sequencing can provide valuable insights into which bacteria are present in the microbiome, whole genome sequencing can provide a more complete taxonomic and functional representation of the microbial community.

This was also true for other diversity measures (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">12</xref>: Figure S8), but is opposite what was seen for our 16S rRNA Shannon diversity measures, where urban subjects had higher diversity at the upper taxonomic levels, with no significant difference or lower diversity at the lower taxonomic levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S4).

Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that at higher phylogenetic levels changes in evenness in a few dominant taxa drive our observed differences in 16S diversity. These dominant taxa may be a result of 16S rRNA sequencing bias. In contrast, there appear to be fewer dominant taxa in the whole genome sequencing data, which detected many more taxa at each phylogenetic level compared to 16S rRNA sequencing (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>: Table S4), and provides a more consistent view of decreased diversity with urbanization across all phylogenetic levels, no matter which diversity measurement is used.</p><p id="Par24">Using our linear models on the taxonomic data generated from our whole metagenome sequencing, we detected 60 species, 44 genera, 71 families, 35 orders, 21 classes, 9 phyla, and 3 domains significantly different between urban and rural subjects after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">13</xref>: Table S5A-G). Most of these taxa were more abundant in rural subjects, further supporting the hypothesis that urbanization is associated with a loss of potentially beneficial bacteria (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">14</xref>: Figure S9). Interestingly, all three domains detected (Bacteria, Archaea, and Virus) were significantly different between urban and rural subjects (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>i), suggesting that urbanization results in an overall loss of Archaea and Viruses and a very small but significant increase in the relative abundance of Bacteria. Archaea are an understudied part of the microbiome, but are generally methanogens. They have been associated with leanness and archaebiotics have been proposed to modulate the risk of atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

For example, 10-undecenoate (11:1n1) was positively associated with the family Leuconostocaceae or other taxa belonging to this family in both 16S rRNA and whole genome sequencing. Leuconostocaceae are lactic acid bacteria previously shown to undergo niche-specific evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and are associated with ulcerative colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], while 10-undecennoate (11:1n1) has been associated with colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

Thus, urban/rural status is strongly associated with microbial composition as measured by whole-genome shotgun sequencing, confirming our observations from sequencing the 16S rRNA gene, including dysbiosis in the relative abundance of entire taxonomic domains.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Urban subjects have increased gene diversity, including increased antibiotic resistance</title><p id="Par26">We also used our whole genome sequencing data to analyze the relative abundance of KEGG modules and pathways (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Again, we saw a significant separation between urban and rural samples, indicating that the gene content is changing with the altered microbial composition. Intriguingly, the urban samples had increased diversity compared to rural samples, opposite the results seen from the whole genome sequencing taxonomic results, which were generated from the same reads (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">12</xref>: Figure S8 and Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM16" ref-type="media">16</xref>: Figure S10).

</p><p id="Par27">There were 10 modules and 51 pathways significantly different between urban and rural subjects, many of which were involved with metabolism, helping to confirm our metabolite findings (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">13</xref>: Table S5H-I). For example, M00048 (inosine monophosphate biosynthesis) was one of the modules significantly more abundant in rural samples while the metabolite inosine was also significantly higher in rural samples. Likewise, ko00280 (valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation) was significantly lower in rural samples, while the metabolite gamma-glutamylvaline, which is likely a short-lived intermediate from protein degradation on the way to specific amino acid degradation, was also significantly lower in rural subjects, suggesting a decrease in valine degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. While the majority of these KEGG functions were more abundant in rural samples, the proportion of significant functions higher in rural was not as pronounced as in the taxonomic results (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM18" ref-type="media">18</xref>: Figure S12). Twenty-three modules and 4 pathways were associated with our metadata, including many of the three-day dietary measures, while 139 modules and 9 pathways were associated with metabolite data, suggesting a stronger interaction between gene content, diet, and metabolites than what was seen with the taxonomic data (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM15" ref-type="media">15</xref>: Table S6C-D).</p><p id="Par28">One set of genes of particular interest when comparing urban versus rural participants is the genes encoding antibiotic resistance. To analyze the presence of antibiotic resistance in the microbiome, we mapped all reads from our whole genome sequencing analysis to the comprehensive antibiotic resistance protein homolog database (CARD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Genes in this database are genes whose presence confers antibiotic resistance, such as &#x003b2;-lactamases. We found that significantly more reads from urban subjects mapped to the database than rural subjects (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d), suggesting that urbanization is associated with increased antibiotic resistance, even though antibiotic use was not different between the two groups (no subject had taken antibiotics in the past 3&#x000a0;months and only three had taken antibiotics in the past 6&#x000a0;months, two of which were rural and the other urban). Of the three urban samples with the highest rates of antibiotic resistance genes, only one had taken antibiotics in the past 6&#x000a0;months. Furthermore, if we remove the three urban samples with the highest proportion of reads mapped to CARD, we still get a <italic>P</italic> value of 0.05, suggesting these results are not driven entirely by these three points. Taken together, our results may have important implications for the efficacy of antibiotics in treating infections in the urban population, as many antibiotic resistance genes are encoded on plasmids and easily move between bacterial strains. Thus, some of the increased gene content in urban subjects encodes genes that could potentially harm the host.</p><p id="Par29">When we looked for associations between the proportion of reads that mapped to antibiotic resistance genes and our microbiome, metadata, and metabolite data, we found no significant associations between the metabolite data or metadata. In contrast, 80 KEGG modules and 135 KEGG pathways were significantly associated with the proportion of reads that mapped to antibiotic resistance genes (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM19" ref-type="media">19</xref>: Table S7). In considering the associations between the proportion of antibiotic resistant reads and taxonomy, we found that most of the significant associations with the proportion of reads that mapped to antibiotic resistance genes were with <italic>Escherichia</italic> and <italic>Shigella</italic> in both our 16S rRNA and whole genome sequencing data (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM20" ref-type="media">20</xref>: Figure S13; Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM19" ref-type="media">19</xref>: Table S7A&#x02013;B). Intriguingly, a significant association appeared in all OTUs or species classified as belonging to these genera, and in all higher taxonomic levels that these genera belong to. Many of these taxa were significantly higher in urban subjects in the 16S rRNA analysis and trended towards higher relative abundance in the whole genome sequencing data. Taken together, these data demonstrate associations between urbanization, an increased relative abundance of <italic>Escherichia</italic> and <italic>Shigella</italic> and an increased proportion of reads mapping to antibiotic resistance genes<italic>.</italic> Our data are therefore consistent with a hypothesis that during urbanization, these genera become more abundant, bringing with them genes that result in increased antibiotic resistance.</p><p id="Par30">In order to further assess the presence of genes associated with virulence and pathogenicity, the whole genome sequencing reads were also aligned to MvirDB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], a database that combines genes associated with virulence factors, toxins, and pathogen-host interactions. As with the CARD database, we found that a significantly higher proportion of reads aligned to MvirDB in urban subjects than rural subjects (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e). This was true even after removing the three urban samples with the highest proportion of mapped reads.

Taken together, these data suggest a model in which urbanization results in a Westernization of the gut microbiome, resulting in loss of taxonomic diversity but increase in gene diversity, including loss of Viruses and Archaea but increased antibiotic resistance and virulence, suggesting a loss of microbes beneficial to the host with a gain in potentially deleterious genes, which may be caused by an increase in <italic>Escherichia</italic> and <italic>Shigella.</italic>
</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par31">We have found significant differences between rural and urban subjects in both microbiome community composition, as measured by both 16S rRNA sequencing and whole genome sequencing, and microbiome gene content. In particular, urbanization was associated with decreased microbial diversity, including a loss of Viruses and Archaea. This dysbiosis in non-bacterial domains is highlighted by the fact that differences between urban and rural subjects as measured by 16S rRNA sequencing, which can only capture Bacteria, did not propagate above the family level. This contrasts previous studies that found pronounced microbiome differences at all taxonomic levels, even using 16S rRNA sequencing. However, those studies compared samples from different continents, genetic backgrounds, and social practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In fact, studies focusing on urban and rural differences within Asia found that the microbiome clusters strongly by ethnicity and geography and not by social and dietary lifestyles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Our focus on two neighboring Han communities enabled us to control for differences in ethnicity, geography, and regional dietary patterns and enabled us to find differences even in our recently urbanized populations.</p><p id="Par32">We have done our best to control for diet, antibiotic use, and other potentially confounding factors by showing that our metadata is not significantly different between the two populations, but there always remains the chance that there is some additional variable that can contribute to urban-rural differences that a larger study will be able to identify. Our study made extensive utilization of linear models; however, our linear model <italic>P</italic> values are highly correlated with our nonparametric tests (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM22" ref-type="media">22</xref>: Supplemental Text; Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM23" ref-type="media">23</xref>: Table S9), indicating that lack of normality is not what is driving our results. Given our small sample size of 20 subjects per group, we utilized FDR correction separately for each taxonomic level and did not pool hypotheses across our metabolite, 16S and whole-genome sequencing results for correction. This strategy is anticonservative and increases the chance that some of the associations we report with individual taxa, genes, and metabolites may be the results of overfitting. However, we also identified strong differences between urban and rural community compositions that do not require extensive correction for multiple hypotheses, such as analysis of PCoA axes and the results of machine learning algorithms. So while the results we report for individual taxa, metabolites, and genes will ultimately require validation in a larger cohort, we are confident that the overall differences we report between rural and urban populations are not simply a result of our multiple hypothesis correction strategy. Furthermore, a recent observation in mice found that changes in microbial composition in response to altered diet increase with each generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], so we predict that as we continue to sample these urbanizing populations over time, the microbial differences will become more pronounced. Thus, our study may represent an observation of the early steps towards a fully Westernized gut microbial composition in China.</p><p id="Par33">Of particular interest is our finding of increased relative abundance of genes that confer antibiotic resistance in urban samples, despite the fact that in our study antibiotic use in the past 6&#x000a0;months was not significantly different between urban and rural subjects, and no study participant had used antibiotics in the last 3&#x000a0;months. Our results suggest that changes associated with urbanization may indirectly increase the reservoir of resistant genes and virulence factors via increased colonization by pathogenic <italic>Escherichia</italic> and <italic>Shigella</italic>. Virulence factors encoded by <italic>Escherichia</italic> have previously been associated with diseases such as colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and Crohn&#x02019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Thus, the complex interplay between disease, urbanization, and the microbiome is an important topic for future studies.</p><p id="Par34">In terms of composition, taxa that were more abundant in rural samples were also much less prevalent in the American cohort studied in the HMP. A natural hypothesis is that these taxa&#x02014;higher in rural China but of lower prevalence in America and poorly represented in finished genome sequencing projects&#x02014;represent a beneficial set of microbes that are suppressed but not eliminated by urbanization. Our study therefore suggests the possibility that Westernization of the microbiome drives disease by increasing the prevalence of pathogens, such as <italic>Escherichia/Shigella</italic>, that harbor harmful characteristics, such as antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors, and by reducing the relative abundance of beneficial taxa. Our compositional findings suggest that since these taxa are higher in our rural cohort and are not entirely absent in Western populations, changes in lifestyle could presumably allow them to again become more prevalent, potentially increasing host health. Likewise, our study suggests these taxa as potential targets of probiotics. For example, several <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> species were significantly more abundant in rural samples, and the most significant OTU from 16S rRNA sequencing also belonged to this genus. This genus has been associated with diet and the breakdown of resistant starch and also produces butyrate, which has previously been shown to play an important role in immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Establishing the validity of the hypothesis that the partial Westernization of the microbiome helps to drive disease will ultimately require long-term longitudinal surveys.

These changes include an alteration in the relative abundances of entire domains, particularly loss of Archaea and Viruses with urbanization. Furthermore, our analysis of the composition of the microbiome suggests that the microbes that had a higher relative abundance in the urban Chinese samples also had a higher relative abundance in an American cohort. In addition, the genes encoded by the microbiome and the metabolites generated have significantly altered with urbanization, with an increase in overall genetic diversity as well as in genes associated with resistance and virulence. Our results suggest that urbanization is rapidly altering the gut microbial community, making it more similar to a Western composition, resulting in higher levels of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. These changes are accompanied by an increase in biomarkers of diseases traditionally associated with Westernization, such as diabetes, obesity, and cancer. Taken together, our study suggests a hypothesis that urbanization/Westernization results in rapid convergent evolution across the globe of the microbial community to a dysbiotic state, with an increase in the prevalence of pathogens that harbor harmful genes and a concomitant reduction in the relative abundance of beneficial taxa.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par36">A random sample of individuals from Hunan Province (in Southern China) aged 18&#x02013;65 were selected for the study, with exclusion of individuals who lived in these communities for less than 2&#x000a0;years, were pregnant or lactating, had known cancer, worked in an occupation with potential exposure to arsenic, or had antibiotic use within the past 3&#x000a0;months.
