Here, we profile the interactomes of BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT following treatment with the pan-BET BRD inhibitor JQ1, revealing broad rewiring of the interaction landscape, with three distinct classes of behavior for the 603 unique interactors identified. A group of proteins associate in a JQ1-sensitive manner with BET BRDs through canonical and new binding modes, while two classes of extra-terminal (ET)-domain binding motifs mediate acetylation-independent interactions. Last, we identify an unexpected increase in several interactions following JQ1 treatment that define negative functions for BRD3 in the regulation of rRNA synthesis and potentially RNAPII-dependent gene expression that result in decreased cell proliferation. Together, our data highlight the contributions of BET protein modules to their interactomes allowing for a better understanding of pharmacological rewiring in response to JQ1.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0020"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Treatment with JQ1 induces an extensive BET proteins interactome rewiring</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Structural and biophysical studies expand the target space for BET bromodomains</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Two distinct short linear motifs mediate BET ET domain interactions</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">BRD3 negatively regulates proliferation through Pol I and II mechanisms</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0025"><p>Lambert, Picaud, et&#x000a0;al. report that pharmacological bromodomain inhibition rewires the interactome of the Bromo and Extra-Terminal (BET) proteins, resulting in loss (e.g., histones), maintenance, or gain of interactions.

Direct targeting of BET-BRDs by small-molecule inhibitors such as the high-affinity and pan-BET specificity thienodiazepine (+)-JQ1 (hereafter referred to as JQ1) enables their displacement from Kac (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B). JQ1 displays anticancer activity in cell-culture models, patient-derived xenograft models of NUT midline carcinoma, and in several Myc-driven cancers (reviewed in <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bradner et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). More than 20 clinical trials have been recently initiated to investigate the efficacy of BET-BRD inhibitors in an array of cancers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov" id="intref0010">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>), with overall responses being limited and short lived. Yet, preclinical data suggest that, in combination with existing therapies, BET-BRD inhibitors can potentiate the effects of cell cycle, immune checkpoint, and DNA damage repair inhibitors (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Doroshow et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). An improved understanding of BET protein biochemistry is essential to facilitate the successful progression of BET-BRD inhibitors into the clinic.</p><p id="p0045">Here, we establish the interactome of each BET protein, revealing a rich network of interactions that are modulated following treatment with JQ1. By analyzing the quantitative behavior of 603 interactors, we define three classes of proteins:&#x000a0;those for which interaction decreases&#x000a0;following JQ1 treatment, those whose association remains relatively unchanged, and those that are unexpectedly increased following BRD inhibition. Multiple decreased interactors harbor sequences that can directly associate with BET-BRDs in canonical or new BRD-mediated structural binding modes, and we propose that the tandem BRDs present in each BET protein may be capable of simultaneously recruiting both a histone and a second interactor. Consistent with previous reports, we define two distinct sequence motifs that bind to the BET ET domain in a Kac-independent manner. Last, by examining gained interactors, we identify an unsuspected function for BRD3 in ribosome biogenesis, and a negative role in cell proliferation that is supported by mining genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 datasets. Our findings suggest that pan-BET inhibitors may have the unintended consequence of inhibiting the growth repressive functions of BRD3, in parallel to inhibiting the desired BRD4 positive functions. Taken together, our systematic proteomics, biophysical, structural, and cell biological studies provide a framework to better understand BET biochemistry and promote the rational development of new inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Interactome Profiling Reveals Shared and Distinct BET Protein Interaction Partners</title><p id="p0050">To establish an interaction network for the BETs, we performed affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) on 3&#x000d7;FLAG-tagged BET proteins using optimized protocols enabling recovery of interactors for both DNA-bound and unbound proteins (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Lambert et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>).

BET proteins formed an interconnected interaction network, notably through shared interactions with histones that included association with other BRD-containing proteins, suggesting an intricate physical interplay between Kac readers on chromatin, and reinforcing the scaffolding roles of BET proteins in regulating transcriptional programs (<xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>D).</p><p id="p0060">Consistent with the existence of a CTM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A), BRDT and BRD4 associated with P-TEFb, as previously shown (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Gaucher et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Jang et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>), and with the negative elongation factor (NELF) complex, as was suggested for BRD4 (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Patel et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). Components of negative transcriptional regulators such as the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex preferentially associated with BRD3 and BRD4 while the RNAPII subunits POLR2A and POLR2L, as well as most Mediator subunits, were only identified as high-confidence partners for BRD4 (<xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>D).

Treatment with JQ1 elicited rapid (i.e., within 10&#x000a0;min) changes of the interactions established by each BET, which were sustained, and in some cases enhanced, at 60 and 240&#x000a0;min (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C and 1D).</p><p id="p0070">Collapsing the transcription-related BET interactors to 12 functional groups or protein complexes (encompassing 149 unique interactors; <xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Tables S2</xref>E and S2F) enabled us to capture a network view of the transcriptional interactome changes caused by 1&#x000a0;hr of JQ1 treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A).

However, when crystallizing a Kac-XX-Kac SIRT7 peptide (K272ac/K275ac) with BRD4/BD1, we surprisingly found only the first Kac within the binding cavity. Strikingly, a bulky tyrosine residue located 5 residues downstream of the first lysine (Y277) instead inserted into the BRD cavity, stabilizing K272ac via a hydrogen bond (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>A).

This resulted in an inverted peptide orientation compared to Kac-XX-Kac peptides. While K14ac superimposed well with K5ac from a H4 K5ac/K8ac peptide, the longer backbone linking it to K9ac superimposed with K8ac, sterically filling the remaining volume of the BRD cavity, and resulting in a small helical turn (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>B). Importantly, the conformations of S10 and T11, and their contributions to the stabilization of this helical topology, also suggested a functional role for their post-translational modification during binding.

Phosphorylation on the longer linker on histone H3 (Kac-X<sub>4</sub>-Kac; the second Kac being outside of the BRD) affects BET binding, potentially linking cellular signaling events to epigenetic circuits. Together with the discovery of binding to a new Kac-Y motif (&#x0003e;16,000 KY motifs are encoded in the human proteome), we suggest that the BET BRDs can contact a larger target space than previously appreciated. While our findings still&#x000a0;require testing in a physiological context, they are consistent with a growing list of documented direct associations between BET BRDs and non-histone proteins (reviewed in <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Fujisawa and Filippakopoulos, 2017</xref>). Since we also found that all BET tandem BRDs adopt extended and flexible conformations in solution, it is possible that remote sites&#x000a0;within the same or different proteins can be recognized, allowing one&#x000a0;BRD to engage a histone while the other simultaneously recruits a non-histone protein through Kac-dependent interactions.</p><p id="p0195">We also systematically characterized two distinct specific ET-interaction motifs for BRD4 (corresponding to motifs mapped to BRD9 and WHSC1/WHSC1L1) that lead to binary interactions for a large portion of the JQ1-insensitive interactome.

Inspection of published ChIP-seq data further revealed overlap between BRD4 and BRD9 peaks in mouse AML cells (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Hohmann et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Shi et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>), and between BRD4 and NuRD component CHD4 in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Flynn et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Luo et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that these proteins may occupy many common loci genome-wide (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S7</xref>F). Together, this suggests that the ET-recruitment platform may play a role in maintaining transcriptional complexes on chromatin. Since several cancer patient mutations are expected to perturb this fold (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S5</xref>F), it is possible that loss of ET-mediated interactions contributes to tumor proliferation.

While JQ1 treatment generally results in transcriptional repression, we and others have previously reported that subsets of genes are instead upregulated (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Lov&#x000e9;n et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Muhar et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Picaud et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Picaud et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Zuber et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>), suggesting a locus-specific de-repression of transcription by BET inhibition, the mechanisms of which remain to be studied. Our studies also revealed an unsuspected reorganization of BET interactomes following BRD inhibition, which included re-localization of BRD3 to nucleolar speckles where it can dampen rRNA transcription but only in the presence of functional BRDs. We also report a negative role for BRD3 in cell proliferation in our model system that depends on its BRDs, which was corroborated by large-scale genome-wide CRISPR datasets (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Meyers et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Besides its negative regulation of rRNA transcription, which should contribute to decreased growth, the roles of BRD3 in controlling proliferation are likely more complex, and we present initial evidence for competition with BRD4 for shared targets, as well as an unexpected role of BRD3 levels in regulating the levels of BRD4, and vice versa, at least in the context of overexpressed proteins (schematics in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>F). This has potential implications for cancer etiology, and there are at least some instances in cancer datasets, such as in lung cancer (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Sz&#x000e1;sz et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>), where BRD3 and BRD4 levels have opposite associations with patient survival, with both high BRD3 levels and low BRD4 levels showing protective effects (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S7</xref>G).</p><p id="p0205">Together, our results suggest that a potentially important parameter that should be assessed when evaluating therapeutic inhibition with pan-BET compounds (such as JQ1) is the level of BRD3 expression in relation to other BET proteins. For instance, osteosarcoma HOS cells resistant to JQ1 display increased levels of BRD2 and BRD4 concurrent with a reduction of BRD3 when compared to matched JQ1-sensitive control cells, highlighting that increased BRD3 function does not promote cell growth in this system and that its inhibition may have undesirable consequences (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Lamoureux et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Finally, it is worth noting that diverse types of cancer cells (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Shu et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>) are &#x0201c;addicted&#x0201d; to high BRD4 levels to maintain a pro-proliferative transcriptional program, which could negatively impact the expression levels of BRD2 and BRD3, which in the case of BRD3 could contribute to increased proliferation. We propose that inhibitors that would specifically target, e.g., BRD4 but not BRD3, should be actively pursued, and some initial reports suggest that this may be feasible (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Nowak et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). In this regard, while it has so far proved difficult to develop BRD inhibitors that exhibit high specificity for a single BET, perhaps targeting additional protein-protein interaction domains, such as the ET, may provide alternative ways to modulate BET association and recruitment with transcriptional complexes, thus improving the current therapeutic window.</p></sec><sec

We note that there were specific issues affecting each of the endogenous antibodies. The BRD2 antibody seemed to have a high number of cross-reacting proteins, notably to components of the mTOR amino acid sensing pathway (GATOR2 components MIOS, WDR24, WDR59, and SEH1L were all abundantly detected). The BRD3 antibody consistently yielded lower recovery of the bait and interactors, making quantitative comparisons to the other BETs more challenging. The BRD4 antibody was raised against a portion in the C terminus of the protein responsible to bind to P-TEFb: consistent with this, no P-TEFb was recovered using this antibody. Since it is not directly possible to compare the recovery of interactors with each BET in this set-up (or in our opinion to identify new interaction partners solely on the basis of this endogenous IP-MS analysis), we therefore used the data in aggregate to assess whether they could provide support to the FLAG AP-MS data. Looking at unique proteins that pass the 1% SAINT FDR cutoff when combining the t&#x000a0;= 0 and t&#x000a0;= 60&#x000a0;min time points for BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4, we recovered 425 proteins in the FLAG AP-MS dataset while 712 and 776 pass the cutoff in the endogenous HEK293 and K652 datasets, respectively.
