<italic>Lancet</italic> paper by Patel
<italic>et al.</italic> on healthcare access in India comprehensively discussed national health programmes where some benefits are linked with the country&#x02019;s Below Poverty Line (BPL) registration scheme. BPL registration aims to support poor families by providing free/subsidised healthcare. Technical issues in obtaining BPL registration by poor families have been previously reported in the Indian literature; however there are no data on family assets of BPL registrants. Here, we provide evidence of family-level assets among BPL registration holders (and non-BPL households) using original research data from the Maharashtra Anaemia Study (MAS).</p><p> Social and health data from 287 pregnant women and 891 adolescent girls (representing 1178 family households) across 34 villages in Maharashtra state, India, were analysed. Several assets were shown to be similarly distributed between BPL and non-BPL households; a large proportion of families who would probably be eligible were not registered, whereas BPL-registered families often had significant assets that should not make them eligible. This is likely to be the first published evidence where asset distribution such as agricultural land, housing structures and livestock are compared between BPL and non-BPL households in a rural population. These findings may help planning BPL administration to allocate health benefits equitably, which is an integral part of national health programmes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>India</kwd><kwd>Below Poverty Line</kwd><kwd>Healthcare benefits</kwd><kwd>Maharashtra Anaemia Study</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>University of Nottingham</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="fund-2"><funding-source>Halo Medical Foundation</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="fund-3"><funding-source>Maharashtra Foundation</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="fund-4"><funding-source>Durga Devi Charitable Trust</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>The Maharashtra Anaemia Study (MAS) was conducted as part of Dr Anand Ahankari&#x02019;s PhD programme with the University of Nottingham UK, which was sponsored by the University&#x02019;s Vice Chancellor Scholarship for Research Excellence International 2013 (Tuition fee support, Ref 12031).

The registration is allocated at family level, based on a scoring system calculated using family level assets such as agricultural land, housing structures, electricity supplies, household equipment. The scoring system varies within Indian states. The BPL status provides access to free healthcare facilities along with monthly access to subsidised food products including but not limited to wheat, rice, cooking oil and sugar.</p><p>There are no data on family assets of BPL registrants.

In this research note, we evaluated family level assets in relation with the BPL registration. The comparison was made in BPL and non-BPL holders for each asset using Chi-square statistics in Stata Software (V.13.1, Texas, USA). </p><p>In total, 287 pregnant women and 1010 adolescent girls participated in data collection, giving an overall response rate of 95%. We selected one person per household at random for the analysis, which resulted in 287 pregnant women (

<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p><p>We observed several participants from both study groups in the MAS, who appeared eligible for the BPL scheme, but had not obtained the registration. Many participants reported technical difficulties as the reason for not having BPL registration. Some of these technical difficulties included having problems procuring the required documents from government officials, and being unable to complete paperwork and other legal documents that are needed to submit the BPL application. This suggests a need to re-evaluate and strengthen the current BPL registration system, and also demands further monitoring to ensure that poor families in need receive vital healthcare and other subsidy benefits. The National Health Mission&#x02019;s initiatives are well meant and have the potential to provide universal health coverage in India; however, implementation is challenging. Strengthening the current BPL registration system and improving identification of poor and needy families might help with achieving the universal health model. This may also help in revising the current health budget to allocate funds for the improvement of the governmental health system. We welcome the review from Patel
<italic>et al</italic>. (2015) and suggest continuing evaluation of both national health projects and the BPL registration process, which will be useful in underpinning healthcare facilities whilst widening access.</p></sec><sec><title>Data availability</title><p>The data referenced by this article are under copyright with the following copyright statement: Copyright: &#x000a9; 2017 Ahankari A et al.</p><p>Data associated with the article are available under the terms of the Creative Commons Zero "No rights reserved" data waiver (CC0 1.0 Public domain dedication).

</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Government Medical College of Aurangabad, India (Reference number: Pharma/IEC/GMA/196/2014), and also by the Nottingham University Medical School Research Ethics Committee (Reference number: E10102013). All participants and their guardians provided signed informed consent for the survey and blood withdrawal separately. Each consent was countersigned by the primary investigator (AA). Other than those who declined to participate, all adolescent girls and pregnant women received a standardised health report including information on their haemoglobin level and anaemia status along with facilitated access to educational materials on anaemia through the health NGO, Halo Medical Foundation&#x02019;s (HMF) village based services. Participant health reports were also provided to the village health worker/government nurse with arrangements for free consultation and assistance if any significant health problems requiring further assessment or treatment were identified during the study. HMF&#x02019;s hospital was also made available for free consultation as a primary referral centre if more specialist assessment or treatment was needed. On completion of data collection, an additional reminder letter was issued to village health workers indicating details of each severe anaemic case in their village to ensure that necessary medical advice and treatment was available.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Professor (Mr) and Mrs Chawathe, Mumbai, India provided generous support for Dr Ahankari&#x02019;s study.
