A total of 535 metabolites were obtained and devided into 11 groups including flavonoids, amino acid and its derivatives, lipids, organic acids and its derivates, nucleotide and its derivates, alkaloids, hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives, carbohydrates and alcohols, phytohormones, coumarins and vitamins.

Endodormancy also has an important impact on the maintenence and producction of the plant, for instance, the anti-season cultivation of some fruit trees. Thus, much attention has been attracted to understand the mechanism of dormancy regulation. External environmental factors, short-day and low temperature, play an essential role in endodormancy induction, and sufficient low temperature accumulation is a necessary prerequisite to bud break [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In <italic>Paeonia lactiflora</italic>, low temperature accumulation at 5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for nine weeks was required to ensure the re-growth of buds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Also, the buds of tree peony &#x02018;Luhehong&#x02019; need to undergo 21 d chilling at 0&#x02013;4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C to ensure the following normal development at growth condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, the requirements of chilling unit are in a genotype dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and significantly different among apical buds, lateral buds and catkins in Persian walnut (<italic>Juglans regia</italic> L.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Many studies have been performed on the mechanism of bud dormancy release, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and molecular biological analysis. These results indicated that vast changes in the metabolism including carbohydrate inter-conversion and transport, lipid mobilization, nitrogen metabolism, phytohormone metabolism and redox processes are associated with chilling induced buds dormancy break [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Till now, there is still rare study on the systematic changes of metabolites and their crosslinks during chilling induced dodormancy transition.</p><p id="Par18">Carbohydrates play multiple roles in plant growth and development, besides acting as the primary source of carbon and energy. Before oxidative phosphorylation, Embden Meyerhof Parnas (EMP), Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA), and Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP) are the main respiration pathways in plants. EMP starts from glucose, which is an end product of starch degradation. Additionally, maltose and fructose also involve in the EMP pathway after conversion to glucose. The anabolic metabolism of sucrose is mainly carried out by two enzymes, sucrose synthase (SUS; EC 2.4.1.13) and invertase (INV; EC3.2.1.26) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. SUS reversibly catalyzes the formation of sucrose from UDP-glucose and fructose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and INV, which irreversibly decompose sucroses into hexose, can be divided into three categories: cell-wall invertase (CWIN), vacuolar invertase (VIN), and cytoplasmic invertase (CIN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">It had been reported that EMP, TCA, and PPP are strictly related to dormancy release in different plants. For example, the TCA cycle is enhanced, while the PPP pathway slowly decreased during apple bud sprouting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In grape, dormancy release induced by chemical and low temperature was found related to PPP, EMP, and TCA cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, carbohydrates could also act as a sugar signaling molecule. Mason et al. (2014) found that sucrose could serve as a signaling molecule involved in paradormancy release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Flavonoids are widespread secondary metabolites in plants, which mainly contain six subclasses: chalcones, flavones, flavonols, flavandiols, anthocyanins, and proanthocyanidins or condensed tannins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The pathway of flavonoid biosynthesis is quite conservative and well understood in some model plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Some genes involved in the production of common precursors, such as <italic>chalcone synthase</italic> (<italic>CHS</italic>), <italic>chalcone isomerase</italic> (<italic>CHI</italic>), <italic>flavanone 3-hydroxylase</italic> (<italic>F3H</italic>), and <italic>flavonoid 3&#x02032;-hydroxylase</italic> (<italic>F3&#x02019;H</italic>)<italic>,</italic> are called Early Biosynthetic genes (EBGs). Correspondingly, downstream genes for flavonoid biosynthesis are called Late Biosynthetic genes (LBGs). The pathway of flavonoids biosynthesis can be affected by biotic and abiotic factors (e.g., pathogen infections, temperature, drought, plant hormones) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, recent reports had shown that flavonoids involved in plant stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], pollen development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], color formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], etc. However, it is still unknown whether flavonoids participate in the process of dormancy release.</p><p id="Par21">It is well known that external factors always work through internal factors during bud dormancy release, and hormones play an important role in dormancy regulation. With the extension exposure to dormancy-inducing conditions (short-day or low temperature), the expression of growth-promoting signals gene (<italic>FLOWERING LOCUS T</italic>, <italic>FT</italic>) is inhibited, leading to reduce gibberellins (GAs) levels and increase abscisic acid (ABA) contents, and the ABA response could induce the close of plasmodesmata, thereby mediating the establishment of dormancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. GA and ABA not only involve in the establishment of growth cessation, but also play a key role in dormancy release. During dormancy release, the reopening of plasmodesmata could restore the supply of growth-promoting signals with the increasing biosynthesis of GAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. On the other hand, the degradation of ABA is necessary for bud dormancy release in grapes, while ABA is accumulated during dormancy establishment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The recent reports showed that <italic>SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP)-like</italic> (<italic>SVL</italic>) with sequence homology to the <italic>Dormancy Associated MADS-box</italic> (<italic>DAM</italic>) genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], plays a vital role in the dormancy of poplar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Low-temperature decreases ABA levels and reduces <italic>SVL</italic> expression, leading to the induction of <italic>FT1</italic> expression and GA biosynthesis, which promotes dormancy release.</p><p id="Par22">Tree peony (<italic>Paeonia suffruticosa</italic> Andr.) belonging to the <italic>Moutan</italic> subfamily of the genus <italic>Paeonia</italic>, Paeoniaceae, is one of the most ancient ornamental and medicinal plants in the world. The bud of tree peony is a typical compound bud with scale forming in autumn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and it must undergo a period of low temperature to ensure the sprouting and flowering in the next year. Due to the short and concentrated florescence every year, its anti-season culture becomes an important content of the tree peony industry. Until now, the primary method of anti-season production is to provide sufficient low temperature exposure alone or chilling enduration combining with gibberellin application. Therefore, it is of great value to understand the mechanism of chilling induced dormancy release in tree peony. Our previous study characterized the relationship between chilling accumulation and dormancy status, the physiological status of tree peony &#x02018;Luhehong&#x02019; after 14 d chilling treatment was regarded as the transition stage from endodormancy to endodormancy release, and that after 21 d chilling treatment was defined as dormancy release, and after 28 d chilling as a stage of ecodormancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. GA pathway plays a crucial role in endodormancy release induced by chilling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. And the activity of PPP pathway also increases during the process, suggesting that it play a role in dormancy release of tree peony [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As known, traits are more closely related to metabolites, which may provide a new perspective for the understanding of dormancy transition in tree peony.</p><p id="Par23">Here, metabolic changes of tree peony buds during the chilling induced dormancy transition were analyzed. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that differential metabolites involved in various metabolic pathways such as carbon metabolism, secondary metabolite synthesis, and hormone metabolism. It was revealed that starch degradation and EMP activity were enhanced during dormancy release. Interestingly, flavonoids anabolism was also activated by chilling accumulation, and its increasement might in return promote flower bud development. Furthermore, the concentration of plant hormones, such as ABA, jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA),and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) during the dormancy transition were also evaluated in this research. Significantly, the roles of flavonoids were firstly discussed during the dormancy transition in perennial plants. All results would provide valuable information for the molecular mechanism of dormancy transition in tree peony.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Metabolomics analysis during chilling induced dormancy transition</title><p id="Par24">To study the metabolic changes during chilling-induced dormancy release in tree peony, flower buds were picked at five time points after 0&#x02013;4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C treatment for 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 d, respectively, and metabolic profiling was analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).

The results indicated that some metabolism pathways were activated by the prolonged chilling exposure. Interestingly, the number of up-regulated metabolites decreased when comparing 14 d vs 0 d with 7 d vs 0 d. To better understand the metabolites changes caused by different chilling durations, the venn diagram of 118 DMs was constructed, showing that four metabolites were common among the four comparisons, i.e. 7 d vs 0 d, 14 d vs 0 d, 21 d vs 0 d, and 28 d vs 0 d (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b; Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

Some monosaccharide (G6P, glucosamine, and trehalose 6-phosphate) and polysaccharides (maltotetraose, melezitose, and melezitose <italic>O</italic>-rhamnoside) were up-regulated after 7 d chilling exposure, and then their contents reduced (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a).

A Gas Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) measurement was then employed to further analyze the change of sugars during the chilling process in tree peony, and the results were similar to the metabolomics data. Fructose, glucose, and inositol were the three most abundant kinds of monosaccharides. The content of maltose significantly decreased after 7 d chilling treatment.

Taken together, we proposed a work model of dormancy transition induced by chilling according to the metabonomics analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Our results might help to better understand the dormancy transition of perennial plants.
