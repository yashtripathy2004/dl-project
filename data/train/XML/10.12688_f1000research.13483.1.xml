<bold>Background: </bold>The ocular surface is separated by a thin layer of tear film from outdoor air pollutants making individuals exposed to outdoor air pollution prone to various ocular surface disorders. The aim of this study was to determine the magnitude of ocular surface disorders symptoms among traffic police officers of Kathmandu, Nepal.</p><p>
<bold>Methods:</bold> Two hundred traffic police officers working at different traffic police office branches of Kathmandu, Nepal were invited to the police headquarters for eye and vision examination. Among them, 91 individuals (95% males) completed the ocular surface disease index (OSDI) questionnaire and underwent Schirmer&#x02019;s I tear test.</p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> Symptoms of ocular surface disorders were reported by over 80% of the individuals. Approximately two-fifths of the individuals (38%) reported severe symptoms.&#x000a0; Only 17% of the individuals&#x02019; tear secretion was found to be below normal using the Schirmer&#x02019;s tear test. No significant association was observed between the OSDI score and Schirmer&#x02019;s tear test scores (r = 0.008, p = 0.94). A weak but significant relationship was observed between the OSDI score and job duration (r=0.21,p = 0.04). Individual exposed to outdoor air pollution for more than 10 years had higher odds of reporting ocular surface complaints as compared to those who were exposed for less than 10 years (OR = 3.94, p = 0.02).</p><p>
<bold>Conclusion:</bold> Ocular surface disorder symptoms are common among traffic police officers of Kathmandu, Nepal. The duration of exposure appears to significantly contribute to the increased symptoms in this exposed population.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Air pollution</kwd><kwd>ocular surface</kwd><kwd>OSDI questionnaire</kwd><kwd>Kathmandu</kwd><kwd>Dry Eye</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="version-changes"><sec sec-type="version-changes"><label>Revised</label><title>Amendments from Version 1</title><p>We have revised the manuscript according to the reviewers' comments.

<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. There are only a handful of studies demonstrating the association between the signs and symptoms of the ocular surface with air pollution
<sup><xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Studies are even more infrequent from cities in developing countries, where the concentration of air pollutants in the environment is on rise. Air pollutants include minute particles such as particulate matter (PM), ozone (O
<sub>3</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO
<sub>2</sub>) and sulphur dioxide (SO
<sub>2</sub>). The most common measures of air pollution are the concentration of PM
<sub>2.5 </sub>and PM
<sub>10</sub> in the air. PM
<sub>2.5 </sub>denote particulate matter that is smaller than 2.5 um and PM
<sub>10 </sub>denote particulate matter less than 10 um. Sources of air pollution include combustion of wood and fossil fuels, road transport, forest fires, road and building construction
<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. In Kathmandu, road transport is the main cause of air pollution. Over the last 20 years there has been a rapid increase in the number of vehicles in the Kathmandu valley. The increasing purchase of private vehicles due to inefficient public transport system may have led to the increase in the number of vehicles. From a cumulative number of 20,000 vehicles registered in the year 2000, the latest number of vehicles registered in the Kathmandu Valley has reached over 90,000 in the year 2015/16
<sup><xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Kathmandu is considered as one of the most highly polluted cities in the world, and Nepal is listed as one of the most polluted countries according to the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/phe/health_topics/outdoorair/databas/cities/en/">WHO urban air pollution database</ext-link>. The annual average of the PM
<sub>2.5</sub>, CO and NO
<sub>2</sub> concentration of Kathmandu for the year 2015 was 49 &#x000b5;g/m
<sup>3</sup> (range, 24&#x02013;70), 438 &#x000b5;g/m
<sup>3</sup> (range, 298 &#x02013; 517) and 176 &#x000b5;g/m
<sup>3</sup> (range, 47 &#x02013; 315) with a maximum concentration during the winter season
<sup><xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Similarly, even though the annual average value of black carbon (BC) is not available,
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/17/6503/2017/">a study conducted in Kathmandu in 2014</ext-link> reported the levels of BC between 16.74 &#x000b5;gC/m
<sup>3</sup> &#x02013; 16.74 &#x000b5;gC/m
<sup>3</sup> during the duration of their data collection period ((16 February&#x02013;4 April 2014) and (20 July&#x02013;22 August 2014))
<sup><xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. These values are clearly higher than the recommended level which raises a significant concern regarding the health of people exposed to these conditions.</p><p>Traffic police officers in Kathmandu are prone to air pollution related disorders as they spend most of their time outdoors at various intersections controlling the flow of vehicles as modern electronic traffic management systems are unavailable in the city. Plenty of previous studies have reported a higher prevalence of respiratory disorders and early biological changes in the DNA
<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> of traffic officers who are exposed to air pollution as compared to control population
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. However, very little attention has been paid on the ocular effect of air pollution in this population. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the magnitude of ocular surface disorders based on a subjective symptoms questionnaire and a commonly used tear secretion test (Schirmer&#x02019;s I test) in traffic police officers of Kathmandu, Nepal. In addition, the association between the two tests in this population was explored.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>This study involved a cross-sectional, community-based assessment on 91 traffic police officers (86 male, 5 female) recruited among the officers of the Traffic Metropolitan head office, Baggikhana, Kathmandu, Nepal. The participants were invited by word of mouth by the head officer along with a formal written notice. Participants with any chronic illness, smoking habit, taking any systemic drugs, having any ocular diseases, previous ocular surgery and current contact lens wear were excluded from the study. All of the individuals had presenting visual acuity of better than 20/25 at both near and far.

The test was conducted in an indoor setting at room temperature. After instilling one drop of proparacaine in each eye, the eye was dried with cotton for any residual drop. The Schirmer strip was then placed on the lateral 1/3rd aspect of the lower eye lid taking special care not to touch the cornea. The strip was removed from the lid after 5 minutes. The Schirmer&#x02019;s test value is variable in normal individuals making it hard to determine cut-off value between normal and abnormal.

However, the finding that the mean symptom score is not significantly different between individuals who have held the job for 5&#x02013;10 years and in those over 10 years signifies that exposure to ambient air pollution over 5 years poses a significant impact on the ocular surface. Furthermore, the higher odds of having ocular symptoms in individuals with over 10 years of holding the job suggests that the effect of air pollution on the ocular surface may have a cumulative effect over the years until symptoms start to appear.</p><p>Nepal was ranked as the 177th country just above China, Bangladesh, and India among the 180 countries with air quality issues according to the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) of 2016
<sup><xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. A report in 2007 on the air pollution concentration, specifically of the PM
<sub>2.5</sub> of the Kathmandu valley, was found to be 17-18 fold higher than the recommended 25ug/m
<sup>3</sup> threshold provided by the WHO. A 2016 air pollution report of Nepal provided by the WHO has shown a considerable increase in PM
<sub>2.5 </sub>concentration over a decade
<sup><xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Our study was conducted in the month of August 2017. The mean 24-hour average PM
<sub>2.5 </sub>concentration during that month was 113.5 ug/m
<sup>3</sup>(approximately 5 fold higher than that recommended by the WHO) and the PM
<sub>10</sub> concentration was 633ug/m
<sup>3</sup>(approximately 13 fold higher than the WHO recommendation) (see
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aqicn.org/city/kathmandu/">Kathmandu Air Pollution: Real-time Air Quality Index</ext-link> and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pollution.gov.np/#/?_k=d5avs2">Department of Environment, Air Quality Monitoring</ext-link>). In light of the high levels of air pollution of Kathmandu, the higher number of individuals reporting severe symptoms of ocular surface disease in our study can be explained. Furthermore, the month of August is generally hot (average temperature, 29 degrees) and humid (average humidity, 83%) in Kathmandu. People often use fan and air conditioning indoors. In addition, there is in increase in the allergens in the environment during this season that may lead to an increased frequency of itching, foreign body sensation and photophobia. All these factors may also have contributed to the increasing symptomatology of officers enrolled in this study.</p><p>While this study provided novel ocular health issues in this more exposed population, some limitations must be acknowledged. Firstly, only two tests &#x02013; the OSDI questionnaire and the Schirmer&#x02019;s I test were used to determine ocular surface disorder. Use of more sensitive tests such as corneal and conjunctival staining, tear film break up time and tear osmolarity may have detected more individuals with ocular surface disorders, and may also have demonstrated structural/physiological anomalies of the ocular surface. However, as this was a community-based study, tests were chosen based on the non-requirement of sophisticated clinical instruments and investigations. Secondly, we were unable to assess the actual duration and concentration of air pollution exposure in our study participants. Measurement of the PM
<sub>2.5</sub> and NO
<sub>2</sub> concentration, along with a range of other ocular surface disorder diagnostic tests similar to that of few previous studies
<sup><xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, would have provided us a better understanding of the association between air pollution and ocular surface disorders. Thirdly, a comparison with a control group of individuals who were not exposed to such level of air pollution or exposed to a lower level of air pollution would have allowed us to confirm that the ocular symptoms were primarily due to air pollution. Finally, we advise researchers to interpret the findings of this study with caution because of the inherent limitations of the cross-sectional nature of this study. Nevertheless, this study was the first step toward generating awareness, and exploring symptoms related to ocular surface disorder in this more exposed population. Future large-scale, longitudinal studies along with the inclusion of comprehensive tests of air pollution and ocular surface disorders are necessary to explore the detailed extent ocular surface anomalies in this population. Necessary precautions need to be taken in order to protect the ocular health of people exposed to outdoor air pollution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Traffic police officers of Kathmandu valley have a high prevalence of ocular surface complaints, which do not correlate well with the subjective tear secretion test. The duration of job appears to somewhat contribute to the increasing symptoms. In the meantime, the use of protective sunglasses
<sup><xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and regular eye consultations for people who are exposed to outdoor air pollution is recommended. More importantly, the government must implement new rules to reduce the levels of outdoor air pollution.</p></sec><sec><title>Data availability</title><p>The data referenced by this article are under copyright with the following copyright statement: Copyright: &#x000a9; 2018 Paudel N et al.</p><p>Data associated with the article are available under the terms of the Creative Commons Zero "No rights reserved" data waiver (CC0 1.0 Public domain dedication).

<bold><italic> since in Kathmandu vehicular traffic seems to be very intense, the additional information about these air pollutants is essential as part of the study."</italic></bold>
</p><p> Response: Thank you very much for your comment. We agree with the comments. We had already provided the August 2017 data on PM
<sub>2.5</sub> and PM
<sub>10</sub> concentration in the first version. As there is no national mechanism to measure the NO
<sub>2</sub> system in Nepal the data from August 2017 is not available. However, in our latest version, we have included the NO
<sub>2</sub> data of 2015. Please refer to the introduction.&#x000a0;</p><p>
<italic><bold>Comment: In addition to the air pollutants, I suggest mentioning the meteorological data, such as humidity and temperature, since these climatic factors may influence the clinical parameters of the ocular surface.</bold></italic>
</p><p> Response: Thank you. The meteorological data has now been added.&#x000a0;</p><p>
<italic><bold>Comment:&#x000a0;&#x000a0;The study was conducted during the hot and rainy season. In this period there is an increase </bold></italic>

<italic><bold>during the</bold></italic>
<italic><bold> dry season in the same group of traffic police officers. </bold></italic>
</p><p> Response: We absolutely agree with the comment. We have included these factors in the discussion. We also agree that it would be interesting to carry out the same tests and ophthalmologic examination during the dry season in the same group to gain a better understanding of the causative factors of ocular symptoms in this population. We are planning such a study at the moment.&#x000a0;</p><p>

</p><p> Response: Thank you very much for this close observation. We have mentioned the cross-sectional nature of the study as one of the limitations and hence have advised that caution must be applied before interpreting the research findings.&#x000a0;</p><p>

We have done our best to address your comments. We hope that our reply is satisfactory and that we have responded to, and dealt with, all comments adequately. Please see responses below:</p><p>
<italic><bold>Comment:&#x000a0;This paper describes a limited analysis of eye symptoms in a small group of traffic police officers in Kathmandu, Nepal. Despite the limitations of the cross-sectional set-up and limited resources, this analysis merits publication because of the small volume of studies on ophthalmological effects of air pollution and the health effects of air pollution in non-western countries with extremely high air pollution exposures.</bold></italic>
</p><p> Response: Thank you very much for your kind comments. We agree with the limitations of the study but hope that this study will be the first one to raise awareness among affected individuals and concerned parties regarding the effect of air pollution on ocular health.&#x000a0;</p><p>
<italic><bold>Comment: The article would benefit from a brief description of concentrations of other common (gaseous or solid) air pollutants (NO2, CO, BC) during August 2017 and annual averages in the previous years in Kathmandu if available.</bold></italic>
</p><p> Response: Thank you very much. We apologise for the unavailability of the NO
<sub>2</sub>, CO and BC data for the month of August 2017 as Nepal does not have a national mechanism to collect these data. We have gathered as much relevant information as we can from the published literature and have incorporated in the latest version.&#x000a0;</p><p>
<italic><bold>Comment: The total number of questions in the OSDI questionnaire could be mentioned to facilitate the interpretation of the formula used.</bold></italic>
</p><p> Response: This has now been incorporated with the OSDI questionnaire attached as a supplementary file.&#x000a0;</p><p>
<bold>Comment: The description of the Schirmer I test is too brief to be easily understood by air pollution scientists who are no experts in ophthalmology. To consider only values &#x0003c;5 mm as abnormal seems to be a very strict definition e.g. compared to results presented by Karampatakis et al.

</p><p> Response: Thank you for this thoughtful comment. We have included some additional information regarding the Schirmer's test. The value of &#x0003c;5mm for abnormal was based on its diagnostic accuracy. This has been briefly mentioned in the manuscript.&#x000a0;</p><p>
<italic><bold>Comment: Based on RE &#x00026; LE combined the % of abnormal tests is less than 15% (not 17%).&#x000a0;</bold></italic>
<italic><bold>Also</bold></italic>
<italic><bold> there is no explanation about the OSDI of the 9% of participants that did not undergo a Schirmer I test, this could potentially lead to biased results.</bold></italic>
</p><p> Response: Thank you for pointing this out. We have rectified the percentage. We apologise for&#x000a0;the lack of clarification regarding the 91% who underwent the Schirmer Test. This data was based on an earlier data analysis. We did not include the data from those patients who had incomplete information hence they were not analysed in this study. Only participants who had both the Schirmer's and OSDI scores were included in the study.&#x000a0;</p><p>
<italic><bold>Comment</bold></italic>
<italic><bold>:In</bold></italic>
<italic><bold> Figure 1 the categories of Mild (23%) and Moderate (20%) seem to have been mixed up. The authors should double check whether this also happened with other categorizations (not available from the provided data) and repeat the statistical analysis if necessary. By providing more original (not categorized) data reanalysis of the data by other researchers would also be facilitated.</bold></italic>
</p><p> Response: We have now rectified the percentage. This was an error during plotting the graph. We confirm that this has not affected any other analysis. The dataset file consists of all the information that we collected and were relevant to the study project. The categorisation of age group was suggested by the editorial office.&#x000a0;</p><p>
<italic><bold>Comment: The methods section does not mention that a paired t-test was used to compare </bold></italic>
<italic><bold>results</bold></italic>
<italic><bold> of the Schirmers I test for RE and LE.</bold></italic>
</p><p> Response: Thank you very much. We have mentioned it now.&#x000a0;</p><p>
<italic><bold>Comments: Because of the cross-sectional set-up of the </bold></italic>
<italic><bold>study</bold></italic>
<italic><bold> it would be more prudent to avoid the word &#x02018;implies&#x02019; in the discussion and instead use &#x02018;suggests&#x02019;.</bold></italic>
</p><p> &#x000a0;Response: We have changed to suggests as recommended.&#x000a0;</p><p>
<italic><bold>Comments: The authors provide a good assessment of some of the limitations/weaknesses of their study. Including the lack of a control group, lack of personal/detailed exposure data or on groups with a different level of exposure and lack of more sophisticated eye tests. The inherent limitations of the cross-sectional set-up should also be mentioned.</bold></italic>
</p><p> Response: Thank you so much for your kind comments. We have added the cross-sectional nature of the study as one of the limitations and have advised readers that the results must be interpreted with caution.&#x000a0;</p><p>
<italic><bold>Comments: The study population of traffic police officers could perhaps better be characterized as a &#x02018;more exposed&#x02019; population instead of &#x02018;vulnerable&#x02019; unless there would be a reason why these adults would be more vulnerable than other population groups.</bold></italic>
</p><p> Response: We have changed vulnerable to more exposed. Thank you.&#x000a0;</p><p>
<italic><bold>Comment: With respect to their recommendation of wearing </bold></italic>
<italic><bold>sunglasses</bold></italic>
<italic><bold> the authors should provide a reference to a source providing evidence for the benefits of such an intervention. Were the traffic police officers questioned on the frequency of use of sunglasses during work?</bold></italic>
</p><p> Response: We have added a reference that reports the beneficial effect of glasses on ocular surface disorders such as dry eyes. Unfortunately, we did not ask any&#x000a0;questions regarding the frequency of the use of sunglasses during work but will definitely consider for future studies.&#x000a0;</p><p>
<italic><bold>&#x000a0;</bold></italic>
</p><p>
<italic><bold>Comments: Some minor language issues could be corrected.</bold></italic>
</p><p> Response: We have attempted to reduce such issues as much as possible.</p></body></sub-article></sub-article></article>
